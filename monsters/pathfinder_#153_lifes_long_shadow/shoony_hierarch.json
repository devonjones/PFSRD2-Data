Rumors speak of fiddlehead ferns that increase the speed of one\u2019s gait, cabbages that fortify against toxins, and carrots that grant improved vision. Because shoonies alone know the secret to cultivating such wondrous vegetables, and because such veggies still rot and expire like mundane produce, finding these rare foodstuffs outside the Isle of Kortos is practically impossible.",

They predominantly dwell in the grasslands and hilly plains of the Isle of Kortos. Shoony societies on Kortos are known for their agricultural prowess, industrious work ethic, and skill with tools to shape their environment.<br/><br/> Shoonies have a rich oral history and claim that their kind flourished all around Kortos in the days when the living god Aroden walked among them. Many shoonies believe that Aroden himself personally created the shoonies after he raised the island from the bottom of the sea, and that he had a deep affinity for their people. Whether or not such tales of companionship with the god of humanity are true, shoonies have drastically declined in numbers since Aroden\u2019s death over a hundred years ago. Shoony elders point to strange environmental phenomena around their island home as one cause of their diminishment, and others attribute their decline to the rise of warmongering monsters in the area. In a world where might often makes right, it is hardly a surprise that the peaceful but timid shoonies are becoming increasingly rare.",

            "text": "Native to the coastal provinces of eastern Holomog, these strange amphibians have frilled, iridescent gills that appear asymmetrically on either side of their bodies. Random arrays of spots, stripes, and other patterns decorate their flanks, and it's said no two shimmernewts have the same coloration. Originally, shimmernewts were ordinary (if oversized) amphibians, living their lives between brackish coastal lakes or tidal pools and the steamy jungles nearby. Over time, the ambient chaotic energies flowing through Holomog magically altered their evolution. The shimmernewts of today barely resemble their ancestors.  \n  \n Their inherent chaotic nature has resulted in shimmernewts operating on different cycles from one another. Some are diurnal, some are nocturnal, but most are crepuscular. Shimmernewts that live close to peaceful humanoid settlements are often docile, but wild populations, whether deep in the jungle or in proximity to more violent settlements, can be quite aggressive. When provoked, all shimmernewts can inflate their gills in impressive displays to appear more attractive to mates or more intimidating to rivals. The capricious amphibians lack any natural predators, and conservation-minded locals are trying to prevent them from migrating further inland.  \n  \n Some underground rings host shimmernewt fights, an unsavory form of entertainment made alluring by lucrative betting. Strolling down the docks of any port town in Holomog for a few minutes provokes whispered invitations to these fights. Though many locals decry these fights as inhumane, each time a ring is shut down, another group pops up sooner or later.",

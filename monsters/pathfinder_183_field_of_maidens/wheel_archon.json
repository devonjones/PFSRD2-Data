Indeed, they have a legendary intolerance and single-mindedness in the pursuit of the punishment of evil.  \n  \n Wheel archons can't tolerate deceit and easily see through lies. The sensation of this celestial being's divine eyes all fixing upon a single target is usually enough to encourage honesty, but when a wheel archon detects a falsehood, their righteous wrath takes over and they mete out punishment to sinners without quarter.",

They openly fight back the spread of fiends but also quietly nurture the seeds of virtue within mortals, teaching the denizens of the Material Plane how to act with honor and integrity, enact just laws, and cast off sin and temptation.  \n  \n Archons live in the immense seven-tiered mountain of Heaven. They manifest in the Garden at the mountain\u2019s peak from mortal souls who answer a mysterious voice. There they swear to forever serve the cause of justice and transform into their new archon forms. Intensely orderly in their metamorphosis, new archons begin as lantern archons or other lesser forms, transforming into ever-greater archons as their virtue and achievements grow. Each archon represents a particular virtue, such as hope, charity, justice, or courage, and they gain strength in the presence of mortals who exemplify this virtue. Due to their extremely lawful nature, archons sometimes find themselves at odds with azatas.",

Fire planes are extremely hostile to non-fire creatures.

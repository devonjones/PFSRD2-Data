Draining Thoughts from a creature that is already stupefied doesn't restore any HP to Taviah but increases the victim's stupefied value by 1. Additionally, Taviah views one of the victim's memories, and can choose to alter, enhance, or erase the memory she views as a 4th-level *modify memory* spell. A victim's stupefied condition value decreases by 1 every week.  \n  \n A victim that becomes stupefied 5 in this way is rendered comatose until Taviah is destroyed, becoming permanently unconscious. While unconscious, its stupefied condition doesn't decrease."

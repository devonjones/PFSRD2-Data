Despite their intelligence, they act like cunning, feral beasts for the most part, though they occasionally build tools to aid them in extinguishing life. Sceaduinar sail through the great voids of their home plane, seeking to destroy any sparks of life that find their way into that deadly realm\u2014even the twisted sparks found in undead creatures.  \n  \n When they discover portals to other planes, sceaduinar swarm through in great numbers, slaughtering all they come across. While dwelling outside the Negative Energy plane is uncomfortable for sceaduinar, they can exist for extended periods of time apart from their home. Of course, the feeling of a plane where negative energy isn't the rule doesn't improve these creatures' attitude, and as a result, they tend to be particularly cruel and violent when encountered in such realms.",

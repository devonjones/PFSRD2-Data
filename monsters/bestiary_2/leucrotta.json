More often, a leucrotta considers itself to be the true leader of a gnoll clan, whispering and manipulating a gnoll warchief into doing its bidding or (if it tires of the game) goading them into challenging the leucrotta for leadership and then taking over the clan directly after eliminating its rival.",

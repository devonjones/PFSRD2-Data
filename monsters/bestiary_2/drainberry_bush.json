            "text": "Drainberry bushes are floating bushes that originate from the First World, with long, thorny vines and dense clusters of bright-red berries. Their hollow thorns quickly siphon blood, which is how these carnivorous plants feed, and they rapidly turn consumed blood into fresh batches of delicious berries. Drainberry bushes exude a faint white glow that is a result of stored positive energy.  \n  \nDrainberry bushes exhibit unusually high intelligence and have an astute sense of value. They typically become insulted when creatures attempt to harvest their berries. Creatures that attempt to converse with drainberry bushes finds the plants telepathically convey only short and simple phrases: most commonly, \u201cMoney please,\u201d \u201cDeal good,\u201d \u201cDeal no good,\u201d \u201cWant that,\u201d (with a gesture toward an item it covets), \u201cThank you, customer,\u201d and if necessary, \u201cNo refunds.\u201d Though a drainberry bush considers the market value of its berries to be 25 gp, it greatly prefers interesting art objects as payment\u2014even ones of significantly lower value.",

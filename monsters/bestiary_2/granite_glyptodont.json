Further failed saves against calcification increase the value of the slowed condition. Once a creature's actions are reduced to 0 by calcification, that creature becomes petrified. If the creature isn't petrified, the slowed conditions end once 1 minute passes without the creature failing a save against calcification.   \nEvery 24 hours after it was petrified, the creature can attempt a DC 26 Fortitude save to recover. On a success, it becomes flesh again, but is slowed 1 for the next 24 hours. On a critical success, the creature recovers and isn't slowed. On a failure, the creature remains petrified, but can try again in 24 hours. On a critical failure, the petrification is permanent, and the creature can't attempt any more saves."

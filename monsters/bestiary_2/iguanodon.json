The iguanodon is capable of moving on two feet or on four, quickly switching from one stance to the other depending on whether it needs to move through dense foliage or to reach delectable morsels hanging up in the canopy.  \n  \nAlthough iguanodons are herbivores, they are notoriously quick to anger. Their thumb spikes make their claws particularly devastating weapons. A well-placed blow from one of these claws can turn a hungry predator into a cowering beast with one swift strike. Iguanodons are 30 feet long and weigh 6,000 pounds.",

On Golarion, dinosaurs do exist in the wilder regions of the world, particularly on the continent of Garund, though they are common enough that PCs might find some on display in a menagerie in a northern city, in use as guardian creatures, or even kept by druids as loyal animal companions.",

They\u2019re often found in isolated lands like primeval jungle valleys or plateaus\u2014regions known as lost worlds for their inaccessibility and lack of any encroaching civilization. In addition to dinosaurs, other megafauna can exist in these places as well, along with giant insects or aggressive creatures like bulettes, carnivorous plants, chuuls, and drakes. Such regions can make for perilous and intriguing adventure sites, especially if you combine them with ruins of ancient civilizations to explore once the party has navigated the hostile wilderness regions.",

Lizardfolk, orcs, giants, and other monstrous humanoids sometimes use dinosaurs as mounts, guards, or hunting animals. Humans and other ancestries have also been known to collect dinosaurs, be it to display them in menageries or keep them as exotic pets or guardians. Such activities are generally pursuits of the rich or eccentric, but certain druids and other guardians of nature feel strong kinships with dinosaurs as well and take them on as companions. When dinosaurs establish themselves in regions beyond their normal habitats, it is generally the result of these captive creatures escaping into the wild.",

With their dig-widgets, the Grifters plagued the authorities of several dwarven settlements over the years. Their travels spread dig-widget technology, and numerous improvements have since led to faster and more reliable versions. Though upstanding dwarven mechanics have observed dig-widgets and recognized the complexity of the technology, they've steadfastly refused to adapt something with such an unscrupulous origin.",

Each dig-widget contains numerous simple tools, including a set of mechanical devices that function as thieves' tools, two arms with drills, and two arms with corkscrews for attaching to and climbing surfaces. Once activated, these devices propel themselves forward. Though they have the full faculties typical of a construct, they usually follow a simple routine: avoid notice, pick any lock barring the path, dig past obstacles, and attack if caught. They're rarely left unattended, as a thief needs to be nearby to follow after-both to steal goods and to stop the dig-widget from engaging in further larceny once it's achieved its goal.  \n  \n The source of a dig-widget's power is as much mechanical as it is magical. The gears and springs that provide a dig-widget mobility are an improvement over more primitive true clockwork creations (whose functions require constant winding to remain mobile), but at the cost of security, for a dig-widget's moving parts can be dismantled quickly by thieves and others with the proper training.",

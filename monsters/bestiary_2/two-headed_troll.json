But words hardly do justice to trolls\u2019 capacity for destruction. They are as bloodthirsty as orcs but lacking the discipline, as massive as giants but capable of regenerating wounded flesh in an instant, and as reprobate as ogres but with twice the strength. The only way to really understand the wanton violence of a troll is to experience it firsthand\u2014a fate few would wish even upon their worst enemies.  \n  \n The first thing that comes to mind when most think of trolls is the creatures\u2019 power of bodily regeneration. So potent is this regeneration that the only way to overcome it is to exploit the troll\u2019s vulnerability to acid and fire. It is not enough to slay the troll with caustic or flaming weapons, though\u2014even the smallest scrap of a troll\u2019s flesh can regenerate into a full-size troll given enough time. The only sure way to eradicate a troll menace is to burn the monster\u2019s entire body until nothing remains.  \n  \n Trolls are solitary hunters, for their wickedness is anathema even to other giants. They occasionally roam in small gangs of two to four, but only when prey is plentiful or a particularly strong counterforce has broached their hunting grounds. In rare instances, an old and powerful troll comes to lead small tribes of trolls. Such \u201ctroll kings\u201d possess enough cunning to lead their hordes in devastating raids and massacres, and their presence permanently alters the surrounding ecosystem. A wide variety of trolls exist, from the terrible monster traditionally associated with the name to the water-dwelling scrag and hybrid flood troll. Regional variations exist as well\u2014mountain trolls among stony peaks, for instance, or moss trolls in swampy bayous\u2014 but all share the same trademark regenerative powers and insatiable thirst for blood.",

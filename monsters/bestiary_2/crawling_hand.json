During a summoning ritual gone wrong, the wizard's hand became possessed and later strangled them while they slept. The hand dragged the corpse across the wizard's rooms to their workbench, propped up a knife in a vise, and severed itself from the rest of the body. According to the story, the hand went on to commit several more murders and disappeared into the sewers of a major metropolis, never to be seen again. Some necromancers believe that this original crawling hand still creeps through the shadows of that city, killing as it pleases",

Instead of hands, the zelekhut's arms end in long, barbed chains that crackle with electricity. Whether sent by the powers of Axis or summoned by mortal authorities, the zelekhut seeks out those who continually evade justice\u2014either through active flight, or by abusing their power and station\u2014so as to bring justice to the multiverse's most notorious fugitives and criminals. Indeed, many a zelekhut's quarry are as famous for their ability to evade capture as for the crimes they commit.  \n  \nThough the zelekhut is implacable and unrelenting in enforcing sentences, it does not pass judgments of its own or take the initiative in pursuing targets of opportunity. While hunting a condemned serial killer or notorious thief across half a dozen planes, the zelekhut wouldn't shift a single hoof to capture a corrupt ruler whose offenses are far greater. All zelekhuts understand that laws can and must differ from place to place, and it is not the zelekhut's job to moralize, merely to obey its rightful assignments and track down those who seek to flee their punishment.",

Each type of aeon takes on some form of duality in its manifestation and works either to shape the multiverse within the aspects of this duality in some way, or to correct imbalances to the perfect order of existence. Aeons can bring weal or woe when they appear in a region, and their machinations can raise a nation, raze it, or restore it from ruin. Their reasons are their own, and they rarely share their motivations with others\u2014 they simply create the results they insist through their strange envisioning communication are necessary to maintain the balance of the multiverse.  \n  \n As a result of recent shifts in reality, aeons have begun to reassert a presence in the perfect planar city of Axis. To the aeons, this is merely the latest in a recurring cycle, albeit one that mortals have not yet borne witness to. Once regarded as an independent faction, the living machines known as inevitables are now revealed as having been agents of the aeons all along, and while inevitables have their own shared themes and features, they are very much living but constructed manifestations of the aeons\u2019 war against imbalance\u2014particularly with regard to how this war is waged against the forces of chaos.  \n  \n Aeons have a name for this cyclic return, in which they welcome the industrious axiomites back to their fold and bring the inevitables once again under their control: the \u201cConvergence.\u201d At the onset of the Convergence, a council of pleroma aeons appeared in the Eternal City of Axis, where they revealed that axiomites were wayward aeons, split off long ago to pursue the act of creation. With the latest cycle of change it was time for the axiomites and their creations, the inevitables, to rejoin the aeon cause. While most axiomites and inevitables fell in line, realizing perhaps on a fundamental level of reality that what the aeons said was the truth, some refused to heed the call and waited for the wrath of the aeons \u2014 but that wrath has yet to come. The dual-natured aeons have responded to those who have declined in confusing ways. With some they treat and even bargain, while a handful of others they have destroyed, and a few have been exterminated by the axiomites and allied inevitables. But most of these quiet insurgents they leave alone, allowing these axiomites to continue to create in peace and the inevitables to continue with their duties. How\u2014or if\u2014this Convergence will end is as little understood as the aeons themselves.",

Further enhancing the awfulness, not a patch of skin exists on the misshapen hybrid form, as though it survived its own flaying.  \n  \n When a nuckelavee rides forth from its domain, it wreaks a trail of destruction across the lands surrounding its path. Nuckelavees are considered among the cruelest and most monstrous fey, seen by some as just desserts visited upon those who would befoul the waters of their homes. A nuckelavee, though, doesn't discriminate between those who pollute and those who merely have the misfortune to be in the wrong place at the wrong time.",

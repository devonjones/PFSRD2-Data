These feral flowers understand the speech of forest denizens and often shift and move their groves when they sense danger approaching. They protect their immature and immobile offspring, and if they discover a garden of their young has been despoiled, they track down the perpetrators to unleash a flurry of vengeance upon them.",

A calathgar's blue flowers grow from 3 to 5 feet across (with specimens as wide as 10 feet reported), while the plant itself stands just under 4 feet in height and weighs up to 50 pounds when heavy with seeds.  \n  \nCalathgars' psyches are alien to most sapient creatures. They have little interest in emotion, culture, or ambition, yet they have nearly flawless memories and can share experiences with other calathgars by scent (perceptible to other creatures as a vinegary odor that may reveal their presence) as easily as humanoids can pass on information by speech. While calathgars themselves can't speak, they can typically be reasoned with\u2014though like most protective parents, an incensed calathgar defending its young is rarely in a mood to listen.",

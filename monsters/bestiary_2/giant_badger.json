Of course, the fact that giant badgers find kobolds and others who dwell in underground warrens delicious means that relying on such trained diggers can be a risky endeavor. A giant badger trained for use as a digger or a guardian tends to only obey the commands of one master, and even then they can be prone to unpredictable outbursts for no reason other than pique",

While raging, the giant badger has AC 17, its jaws Strike deals 1d8+8 damage, and its claw Strike deals 1d6+6 damage. While raging, the giant badger also can't use actions that have the concentrate trait except for Seek. After it has stopped raging, a giant badger can't use Badger Rage again for 1 minute."

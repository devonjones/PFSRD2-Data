Short of temper and feeling vindictive, the noble doomed Crawley Jack's people to never consume another fish again. Yet their desire to eat fish never diminished. The curse's punishment is exacted in endless creative ways. A culdewen's catch might be rescued by merfolk, stolen by skum, eaten by nipping sharks, or carried away on a piece of driftwood when the culdewen's boat is destroyed in a storm or shipwreck.",

By the time they arrive, their catch will be gone. Every time. Forever.  \n  \nA foul mood hovers over a culdewen, causing them to swear colorfully, smack things with their oar, and shake their tiny fists at the sky. Conversation with a culdewen is fruitless, as they talk in circles, speaking only of fishing and the weather. Capturing a \u201cfish\u201d gives a culdewen a rare moment of happiness; the culdewen capers and ululates, pleased with their catch, and rushes off to their boat.",

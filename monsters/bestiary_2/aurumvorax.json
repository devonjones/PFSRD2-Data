Aurumvorax warrens can stretch for thousands of feet dug into the rock, often following veins of ores and winding deep into the earth. Mining dwarves love the creatures' fondness for eating rust monsters. Those who keep aurumvoraxes for protection call them golden guardians.",

            "text": "Aurumvoraxes are highly aggressive and territorial predators that sprint on eight legs, using their terrific strength and iron-hard claws to dig through solid stone. A typical aurumvorax is only 3 feet long but weighs more than 200 pounds, for its thick, sturdy bones are densely packed with muscle, making the creature very strong but a notoriously poor swimmer. Its fur is golden, sometimes with a silvery or russet tone depending on the metals it has ingested, and its claws are always the shiny black of seasoned iron.  \n  \nAurumvorax adults claim hunting territories spanning a mile or more, driving out other predators and leading solitary lives except when they mate. They are irascible creatures, impossible to train as adults, but daring trainers can rear aurumvorax pups as deadly guard beasts, which they sell for hundreds of gold pieces to discriminating buyers. Aurumvorax pups are usually single births, and their mothers are fiercely protective, making their acquisition a dangerous proposition. Even when trained, the creatures are prone to dangerous bursts of rage.",

It retains any spellcasting abilities it had in life, regardless of their origin, and gains the abilities listed below. You might need to adjust other abilities that conflict with the monster\u2019s new theme as a worm that walks. <br/><br/><b><a aonid=\"12\" game-obj=\"MonsterAbilities\">Darkvision</a></b><br/><br/><b><a aonid=\"40\" game-obj=\"MonsterAbilities\">Tremorsense</a></b> 30 feet (imprecise) <br/><br/><b>Immunities</b> All worms that walk have immunity to disease, paralyzed, poison, precision, and unconscious. They also have the <a aonid=\"36\" game-obj=\"MonsterAbilities\">swarm mind</a> ability, which makes them immune to <a aonid=\"106\" game-obj=\"Traits\">mental</a> effects that target a specific number of creatures, though they are still subject to mental effects that affect all creatures in an area. <br/><br/><b><a aonid=\"1\" game-obj=\"MonsterAbilities\">All-Around Vision</a></b><br/><br/><b>Discorporate</b> When the worm that walks is reduced to 0 HP, it discorporates and the component worms that make up its body disperse in every direction. If even a single worm escapes, the worm that walks will eventually re-form using a process that typically takes 1d10 days.<br/><br/> While the exact circumstances and surroundings determine how long the worm that walks\u2019s foes have to dispatch the fleeing worms before they escape, usually its foes have only a single round. Typically, this requires the application of an area effect or <a aonid=\"150\" game-obj=\"Traits\">splash</a> weapon within 1 round to the space where the worm that walks collapsed. After any amount of area or splash damage is dealt to that space, the character dealing the damage must attempt a DC 15 flat check. Each subsequent area or splash damage effect performed on the area reduces the DC of this flat check by 2, to a minimum of DC 5. If any of these flat checks succeed, none of the worms escape, and the worm that walks is destroyed permanently. At the GM\u2019s discretion, clever means of trapping or otherwise detaining the vermin may extend the time allowed to finish off the worm that walks. <br/><br/><b>Tendril</b> Regardless of the creature\u2019s former anatomy, it gains a tendril melee Strike with reach that deals <a aonid=\"29\" game-obj=\"Conditions\">persistent piercing damage</a> as it leaves biting worms on the target. If it had any <a aonid=\"170\" game-obj=\"Traits\">agile</a> attacks, the damage dealt by its tendril should be roughly the same as the damage dealt by those attacks. If it had only non-agile attacks, its tendril should deal three-quarters of that damage. <br/><br/><b>Squirming Embrace</b><img alt=\"Single Action\" class=\"actiondark\" src=\"Images\\Actions\\OneAction.png\" style=\"height:15px; padding:0px 2px 0px 2px\"/><img alt=\"Single Action\" class=\"actionlight\" src=\"Images\\Actions\\OneAction_I.png\" style=\"height:15px; padding:0px 2px 0px 2px\"/> The worm that walks Strides, ending its movement sharing a space with a creature, and deals piercing damage to the creature equal to 1d8 plus an additional 1d8 for every 3 levels the worm that walks has. The creature can attempt a basic Reflex save with a DC of the worm that walks\u2019s spell DC \u2013 2. <br/><br/><b>Swarm Shape</b><img alt=\"Single Action\" class=\"actiondark\" src=\"Images\\Actions\\OneAction.png\" style=\"height:15px; padding:0px 2px 0px 2px\"/><img alt=\"Single Action\" class=\"actionlight\" src=\"Images\\Actions\\OneAction_I.png\" style=\"height:15px; padding:0px 2px 0px 2px\"/> (<a aonid=\"32\" game-obj=\"Traits\">concentrate</a>) The worm that walks collapses into a shapeless swarm of worms. It drops all held, worn, and carried items. While discorporated, the worm that walks can\u2019t use attack actions and can\u2019t cast spells, but it can move through areas small enough for its individual worms to fit without having to <a aonid=\"31\" game-obj=\"Actions\">Squeeze</a>. It can use the same action to coalesce back into its normal form.",

Its size entry gives the size of the entire mass, though for most swarms the individual creatures that make up that mass are Tiny. A swarm can occupy the same space as other creatures, and must do so in order to use its damaging action. A swarm typically has weakness to effects that deal damage over an area (like area spells and splash weapons). Swarms are immune to the grappled, prone, and restrained conditions.",

Typically, this requires the application of an area effect or <a aonid=\"150\" game-obj=\"Traits\">splash</a> weapon within 1 round to the space where the worm that walks collapsed. After any amount of area or splash damage is dealt to that space, the character dealing the damage must attempt a DC 15 flat check. Each subsequent area or splash damage effect performed on the area reduces the DC of this flat check by 2, to a minimum of DC 5. If any of these flat checks succeed, none of the worms escape, and the worm that walks is destroyed permanently. At the GM's discretion, clever means of trapping or otherwise detaining the vermin may extend the time allowed to finish off the worm that walks."

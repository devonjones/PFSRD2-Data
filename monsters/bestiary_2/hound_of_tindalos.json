In some references, the implication is that Tindalos is one of the Great Old Ones or Outer Gods, but if this is the case, it is among the most obscure of these entities. Other tomes refer as Tindalos as a location, perhaps even a city or nation that once existed before time began and that can be reached only by methods impossible for any creature bound by the laws of time. In all likelihood, both and neither are right\u2014what Tindalos is may simply be impossible for mortal minds to comprehend.",

Powerful spellcasters can draw them from the Dimension of Time via rare rituals, but doing so attracts the hounds' ire, so few who traffic in such rituals live long enough to spread their knowledge. While the hounds possess great cunning and cruel intellect, they rarely interact with other creatures\u2014other than to hunt and destroy those who have attracted their unblinking attention.  \n  \n Once a hound catches scent of a mortal to hunt, it calls others of its ilk. The pack then pursues its victim through all space and time until it catches, slays and devours them. Those pursued can escape only by avoiding all angles, as hounds of Tindalos could step through them from nothingness at any time.",

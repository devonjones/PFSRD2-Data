Those who seek to fish souls out for their own use stalk this metaphysical river, and it is against these predators that monadic devas fight. At other times, monadic devas work to guide newcomers to the River of Souls who might be in danger of drifting from the current and lingering as ghosts. Monadic devas often find their tasks place them in alliances with psychopomps, and they work well with the monitors despite the philosophical divide between their views on a soul's inherent goodness. A monadic deva is 7 feet tall and weighs 220 pounds.",

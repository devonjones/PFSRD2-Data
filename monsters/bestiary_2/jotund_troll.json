            "text": "Jotund trolls are gigantic, nine-headed horrors who prowl frigid moors, marshes, and wastelands, always alone and always enraged. While each of the jotund troll's nine heads possess their own brains and senses, they work much more in tandem than the dual-minded nature of the two-headed troll. Despite this, the heads often argue and bicker, particularly over which head gets to eat. The fact that all nine maws lead to the same shared stomach makes little difference in such culinary disagreements.  \n  \n Prevailing wisdom holds that the jotund troll represents a primordial, if not original, shape and design for the first trolls to plague the world, arising from a mythical realm in the Great Beyond known as Jotungard. This sprawling domain, said to be nestled in a remote reach of Elysium, is the legendary home of the deities of giant-kind. Whether the jotund troll was created in Jotungard to plague the Material Plane as punishment or challenge, or if it's merely an evocative legend told by scholars, is unknown. In any case, the jotund trolls themselves likely care little.  \n  \n***Unspecific Lore***: DC 37  \n***Specific Lore***: DC 34",

But words hardly do justice to trolls\u2019 capacity for destruction. They are as bloodthirsty as orcs but lacking the discipline, as massive as giants but capable of regenerating wounded flesh in an instant, and as reprobate as ogres but with twice the strength. The only way to really understand the wanton violence of a troll is to experience it firsthand\u2014a fate few would wish even upon their worst enemies.  \n  \n The first thing that comes to mind when most think of trolls is the creatures\u2019 power of bodily regeneration. So potent is this regeneration that the only way to overcome it is to exploit the troll\u2019s vulnerability to acid and fire. It is not enough to slay the troll with caustic or flaming weapons, though\u2014even the smallest scrap of a troll\u2019s flesh can regenerate into a full-size troll given enough time. The only sure way to eradicate a troll menace is to burn the monster\u2019s entire body until nothing remains.  \n  \n Trolls are solitary hunters, for their wickedness is anathema even to other giants. They occasionally roam in small gangs of two to four, but only when prey is plentiful or a particularly strong counterforce has broached their hunting grounds. In rare instances, an old and powerful troll comes to lead small tribes of trolls. Such \u201ctroll kings\u201d possess enough cunning to lead their hordes in devastating raids and massacres, and their presence permanently alters the surrounding ecosystem. A wide variety of trolls exist, from the terrible monster traditionally associated with the name to the water-dwelling scrag and hybrid flood troll. Regional variations exist as well\u2014mountain trolls among stony peaks, for instance, or moss trolls in swampy bayous\u2014 but all share the same trademark regenerative powers and insatiable thirst for blood.",

If a swallowed creature is of the maximum size listed, the monster can't use Swallow Whole again. If the creature is smaller than the maximum, the monster can usually swallow more creatures; the GM determines the maximum. The monster attempts an Athletics check opposed by the target's Reflex DC. If it succeeds, it swallows the creature. The monster's mouth or jaws no longer clutch a creature it has swallowed, so the monster is free to use them to Strike or Grab once again. The monster can't attack creatures it has swallowed.  \n  \n A swallowed creature is grabbed, is slowed 1, and has to hold its breath or start suffocating. The swallowed creature takes the listed amount of damage when first swallowed and at the end of each of its turns while it's swallowed. If the victim Escapes this ability's grabbed condition, it exits through the monster's mouth. This frees any other creature captured in the monster's mouth or jaws. A swallowed creature can attack the monster that has swallowed it, but only with unarmed attacks or with weapons of light Bulk or less. The swallowing creature is off-guard against the attack. If the monster takes piercing or slashing damage equaling or exceeding the listed Rupture value from a single attack or spell, the swallowed creature cuts itself free. A creature that gets free by either Escaping or cutting itself free can immediately breathe and exits the swallowing monster's space.  \n  \n If the monster dies, a swallowed creature can be freed by creatures adjacent to the corpse if they spend a combined total of 3 actions cutting the monster open with a weapon or unarmed attack that deals piercing or slashing damage.",

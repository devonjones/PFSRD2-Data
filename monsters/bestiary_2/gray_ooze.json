For example, some gray oozes have adapted to fully aquatic environments, replacing their movement with a swim speed and gaining a paralytic poison similar to that of gelatinous cubes. Other gray oozes have become charged with psychic energy, gaining the ability to cause nearby creatures to become confused, fascinated, or frightened for a short time.",

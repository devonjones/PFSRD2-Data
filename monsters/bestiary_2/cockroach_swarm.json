Given how disgusting many find cockroaches to be, encountering such a swarm can be alarming to even the most seasoned adventurers. The creatures are relentless when disturbed; in contrast to the insects' normally skittish and harmless nature, as swarms they pursue the creature or creatures that provoked them and harry them with thousands of stinging bites.",

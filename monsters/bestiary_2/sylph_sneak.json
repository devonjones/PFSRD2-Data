Born of unions between mortals and djinn, sylphs are quick-witted and creative, but they are prone to flights of fancy and tend to be easily distracted.  \n  \n Sylphs are notorious for their practice of \u201clistening to the wind,\u201d which most others dismiss as a fancy name for eavesdropping. Yet this custom means much more to sylphs, who spend hours listening to the stories brought to them on the proverbial breeze. While some less scrupulous sylphs may use the information they learn to blackmail or abuse others, most of them see listening to the wind as their way of staying connected to the world around them while still keeping it comfortably at arm's length. Certainly the typical sylph sneak doesn't seek to use what they learn for ill, but instead tries to warn others of dangers yet unrealized or to prepare themself for a dangerous task.",

This is true even when genies are not part of a person's lineage, such as individuals descended from elementals or sorcerers with the elemental bloodline.

Creatures with this trait consist primarily of air or have a connection to magical air.   \n  \nPlanes with this trait consist mostly of open spaces and air of various levels of turbulence, though they also contain rare islands of floating stone and other elements and energies. Air planes usually have breathable atmospheres, though they might include clouds of acidic or toxic gas. Earth creatures often find themselves at a disadvantage within air planes, as there\u2019s little solid ground for them to gain their bearings, which tends to at least make them uncomfortable.",

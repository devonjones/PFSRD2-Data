If one were able to dispel the curse of a vaspercham's shell - or somehow twist the curse to their own benefit - they would be able to craft an incredible suit of spell-reflecting plate mail.",

Once a vaspercham settles on a new home, they stubbornly stay there, regardless of any communities dwelling nearby. A vaspercham's physical might and magic-warping abilities make them incredibly hard to dislodge once entrenched, and many seaside communities have relocated after a vaspercham came calling. The monster responds only to strength, so one must best a vaspercham in combat to gain their begrudging cooperation. But once the creature recovers their strength, they inevitably betray any temporary alliance.",

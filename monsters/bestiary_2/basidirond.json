The large, bowl-shaped pod atop its body collects mineral-rich moisture\u2014-whether runoff from cave walls or fresh blood\u2014-for sustenance. It uses hallucinogenic spores to incapacitate prey long enough for it to beat its prey to a bloody pulp, then deposits the deliciously tenderized remains into this pod for consumption. A basidirond is over 6 feet tall and 3 to 4 feet wide, and weighs nearly 300 pounds when saturated.",

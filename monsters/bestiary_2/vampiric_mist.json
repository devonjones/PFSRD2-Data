            "text": "Though they're often mistaken for <a aonid=\"97\" game-obj=\"MonsterFamilies\">vampires</a> in gaseous form or an unusual type of <a aonid=\"41\" game-obj=\"MonsterFamilies\">air elemental</a>, vampiric mists are in fact strange aberrant life-forms. With an amorphous body that consists as much of fluid as it does of air, these creatures dwell in swamps or moist underground regions where their vulnerability to heat isn't as much of a concern. Still, they prefer to lair near the fringes of such areas, as a vampiric mist needs a constant supply of fresh blood for sustenance. While blood drawn from animals is just as nutritious as blood from anything else, these sadistic monsters vastly prefer the flavor of blood drawn from thinking creatures. Like <a aonid=\"414\" game-obj=\"Monsters\">will-o'-wisps</a>, vampiric mists find that fear flavors the blood, though they gain no particular advantage by feeding on the frightened.<br/><br/> Although somewhat intelligent, vampiric mists do not form societies. They sometimes group into small gangs, but even then they show little interest in working together. Vampiric mists spend most of their time seeking prey\u2014a pursuit they approach with great creativity. The mists' propensity for taking on vague, skeletal forms of the creatures whose blood they drink further adds to their mystique and fuels rumors that they have connections to the undead. Indeed, many vampiric mists enjoy using this common misconception to their advantage, leading foes to apply foolish tactics\u2014such as tricking spellcasters into attempting to use positive energy against them as if they were undead monsters.<br/><br/><b><u><a aonid=\"5\" game-obj=\"Skills\" general=\"true\">Recall Knowledge - Aberration</a></u> (<u><a aonid=\"11\" game-obj=\"Skills\">Occultism</a></u>)</b>: DC 18",

The vampiric mist gains 10 temporary Hit Points and takes on an intense red until the end of its next turn.

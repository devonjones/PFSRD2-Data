            "text": "These gremlins are covered head-to-toe by a crustacean-like exoskeleton that clacks and rattles whenever a vexgit moves. They delight in sabotaging the works of other creatures, often turning these works into dangerous traps. An individual vexgit might jam a door lock, loosen the wheels on a carriage, or remove nails from a boat hull. Buildings infested by vexgits become filled with traps like portcullises descending suddenly, water pipes exploding violently, and clock towers disgorging an avalanches of gears.  \n Aware of their own physical weakness, vexgits carry hammers and other tools to leverage pieces apart or smash whatever they're unable to disassemble. Indeed, a hammer sized for a human becomes a maul in the tiny hands of a vexgit.  \n Vexgit infestations range from one to a score. Larger groups are often led by a more powerful vexgit with additional skill in thievery or primal magic. Trained giant rats, vipers, and rat swarms are common in vexgit lairs.",

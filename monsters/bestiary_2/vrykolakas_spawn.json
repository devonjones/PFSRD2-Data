Instead, it attempts to cast its spirit into an animal within 100 feet, which must attempt a Will save (use a high DC for the vrykolakas's level from the <a aonid=\"1020\" game-obj=\"Rules\">Spell DC and Spell Attack Roll table</a>). On a failure, the animal is possessed. This has the effects of the <a aonid=\"225\" game-obj=\"Spells\"><i>possession</i></a> spell, but it lasts a number of days equal to the vrykolakas's level. This possession can't be counteracted with magic (though <a aonid=\"250\" game-obj=\"Spells\"><i>remove curse</i></a> works against it normally).<br/><br/> If the animal succeeds at its save, the vrykolakas can attempt to possess a different animal within 100 feet. If at any point an animal critically succeeds at its save or no animal is within 100 feet, the vrykolakas fails to possess anything and is destroyed.<br/><br/> A vrykolakas possessing an animal seeks out its burial site (see Burial Site Bound below) immediately, burying itself there. While the vrykolakas is in this state of recovery, its animal host is <a aonid=\"28\" game-obj=\"Conditions\">paralyzed</a>, and beheading it destroys the vrykolakas and kills its host. Removing the curse destroys the vrykolakas and returns the animal to normal. After 1d4 days, if the vrykolakas hasn't been destroyed, the animal dies and the vrykolakas rises in a new body that's identical to its previous one, formed from the animal's remains. <br/><br/><b>Vrykolakas Vulnerabilities</b> Vrykolakas all have the following vulnerabilities. <ul><li><b>Burial Site Bound</b> A vrykolakas is bound to the place of its death or interment. It must return to this location once per week and bury itself in the earth for 24 hours, during which time it is paralyzed and can be beheaded. If it is unable to return to this site, it is reduced to 0 Hit Points and attempts to use Feral Corruption; if this host animal can't return to the burial site before the possession effect ends, the vrykolakas is destroyed and the animal host returns to normal. </li><li><b>Vulnerable to Decapitation</b> A vrykolakas that is beheaded can't use its Feral Possession, and a beheaded corpse cannot rise as a vrykolakas.</li></ul><br/><br/><b>Climb Speed</b> A vrykolakas gains a climb Speed equal to one-half its land Speed. <br/><br/><b>Claws</b> If the base creature had hands, it gains an unarmed claw Strike that deals slashing damage and has the <a aonid=\"170\" game-obj=\"Traits\">agile</a> trait. Use the moderate damage for the creature's level on the <a aonid=\"1018\" game-obj=\"Rules\">Strike Damage</a> table. <br/><br/><b>Fangs</b> The teeth of the vrykolakas grow long, sharp, and deadly, granting it a fangs Strike: an unarmed attack that deals piercing damage and enables the use of its Drink Blood ability. Use the high damage for the creature's level on the Strike Damage table. <br/><br/><b>Drink Blood</b><img alt=\"Single Action\" class=\"actiondark\" src=\"Images\\Actions\\OneAction.png\" style=\"height:15px; padding:0px 2px 0px 2px\"/><img alt=\"Single Action\" class=\"actionlight\" src=\"Images\\Actions\\OneAction_I.png\" style=\"height:15px; padding:0px 2px 0px 2px\"/> (<a aonid=\"48\" game-obj=\"Traits\">divine</a>, <a aonid=\"117\" game-obj=\"Traits\">necromancy</a>) <b>Requirements</b> The vrykolakas' last action was a successful fangs Strike; <b>Effect</b> The vrykolakas sinks its fangs into that creature to drink its blood. This requires an <a aonid=\"3\" game-obj=\"Skills\">Athletics</a> check against the creature's Fortitude DC. On a success, the creature becomes drained 1, and the vrykolakas regains HP equal to 10% of its maximum HP, gaining any excess HP as temporary Hit Points. Drinking Blood from a creature that's already drained doesn't restore any HP to the vampire, but it increases the creature's drained condition value by 1. A vrykolakas can also consume blood that's been emptied into a vessel for sustenance, but it gains no HP from doing so.<br/><br/> The target creature's drained condition value decreases by 1 per week. A blood transfusion, which requires a successful DC 20 <a aonid=\"9\" game-obj=\"Skills\">Medicine</a> check and sufficient blood or a blood donor, reduces the drained value by 1 after 10 minutes. <br/><br/><b><a aonid=\"30\" game-obj=\"MonsterAbilities\">Rend</a></b><img alt=\"Single Action\" class=\"actiondark\" src=\"Images\\Actions\\OneAction.png\" style=\"height:15px; padding:0px 2px 0px 2px\"/><img alt=\"Single Action\" class=\"actionlight\" src=\"Images\\Actions\\OneAction_I.png\" style=\"height:15px; padding:0px 2px 0px 2px\"/> The vrykolakas gains the Rend action with its claws.

Such vrykolakas spawn are generally friendly to the vrykolakas that created them, but they are not under its control and typically wander off on their own rampage within 1d6 days of their creation. <b>Dominate Animal</b><img alt=\"Single Action\" class=\"actiondark\" src=\"Images\\Actions\\OneAction.png\" style=\"height:15px; padding:0px 2px 0px 2px\"/><img alt=\"Single Action\" class=\"actionlight\" src=\"Images\\Actions\\OneAction_I.png\" style=\"height:15px; padding:0px 2px 0px 2px\"/> (<a aonid=\"48\" game-obj=\"Traits\">divine</a>, <a aonid=\"61\" game-obj=\"Traits\">enchantment</a>, <a aonid=\"93\" game-obj=\"Traits\">incapacitation</a>, <a aonid=\"106\" game-obj=\"Traits\">mental</a>) The vrykolakas can cast <a aonid=\"87\" game-obj=\"Spells\"><i>dominate</i></a> at will as a divine innate spell that affects only animals. The save DC is a high DC for the vrykolakas's level, and a creature that succeeds is immune to that vrykolakas's Dominate Animal for 24 hours. Destroying the vrykolakas ends the effect, but reducing it to 0 HP does not. A dominated animal takes a \u20134 circumstance penalty to saving throws against the vrykolakas's Feral Possession. <br/><br/><b>Drink Blood</b> As a typical vrykolakas, but the creature is drained 2 instead of 1.\n",

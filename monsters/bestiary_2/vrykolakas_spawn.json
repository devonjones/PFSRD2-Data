                            "text": "If the base creature becoming a vrykolakas has any abilities that specifically come from it being a living creature, it loses them. It also loses any traits that represented its life as a living creature, such as human and humanoid. You might also need to adjust abilities that conflict with the vrykolakas' theme. All vrykolakas gain the following abilities.   \n  \n**Darkvision**   \n  \n**Swift Tracker** The vrykolakas moves at full Speed while Tracking.   \n  \n**Negative Healing**   \n  \n**Immunities** death effects, disease, paralyzed, poison, sleep   \n  \n**Feral Corruption** [-] (curse, divine, incapacitation, mental, necromancy, possession) **Trigger** The vrykolakas is reduced to 0 Hit Points, and an animal is within 100 feet; **Effect** Unlike most other undead, a vrykolakas isn't destroyed when it reaches 0 HP. Instead, it attempts to cast its spirit into an animal within 100 feet, which must attempt a Will save (use a high DC for the vrykolakas's level from the Spell DC and Spell Attack Roll table). On a failure, the animal is possessed. This has the effects of the *possession* spell, but it lasts a number of days equal to the vrykolakas's level. This possession can't be counteracted with magic (though *remove curse* works against it normally).  \n  \n If the animal succeeds at its save, the vrykolakas can attempt to possess a different animal within 100 feet. If at any point an animal critically succeeds at its save or no animal is within 100 feet, the vrykolakas fails to possess anything and is destroyed.  \n  \n A vrykolakas possessing an animal seeks out its burial site (see Burial Site Bound below) immediately, burying itself there. While the vrykolakas is in this state of recovery, its animal host is paralyzed, and beheading it destroys the vrykolakas and kills its host. Removing the curse destroys the vrykolakas and returns the animal to normal. After 1d4 days, if the vrykolakas hasn't been destroyed, the animal dies and the vrykolakas rises in a new body that's identical to its previous one, formed from the animal's remains.   \n  \n**Vrykolakas Vulnerabilities** Vrykolakas all have the following vulnerabilities. \n* **Burial Site Bound** A vrykolakas is bound to the place of its death or interment. It must return to this location once per week and bury itself in the earth for 24 hours, during which time it is paralyzed and can be beheaded. If it is unable to return to this site, it is reduced to 0 Hit Points and attempts to use Feral Corruption; if this host animal can't return to the burial site before the possession effect ends, the vrykolakas is destroyed and the animal host returns to normal.\n* **Vulnerable to Decapitation** A vrykolakas that is beheaded can't use its Feral Possession, and a beheaded corpse cannot rise as a vrykolakas.\n**Climb Speed** A vrykolakas gains a climb Speed equal to one-half its land Speed.   \n  \n**Claws** If the base creature had hands, it gains an unarmed claw Strike that deals slashing damage and has the agile trait. Use the moderate damage for the creature's level on the Strike Damage table.   \n  \n**Fangs** The teeth of the vrykolakas grow long, sharp, and deadly, granting it a fangs Strike: an unarmed attack that deals piercing damage and enables the use of its Drink Blood ability. Use the high damage for the creature's level on the Strike Damage table.   \n  \n**Drink Blood** [#] (divine, necromancy) **Requirements** The vrykolakas' last action was a successful fangs Strike; **Effect** The vrykolakas sinks its fangs into that creature to drink its blood. This requires an Athletics check against the creature's Fortitude DC. On a success, the creature becomes drained 1, and the vrykolakas regains HP equal to 10% of its maximum HP, gaining any excess HP as temporary Hit Points. Drinking Blood from a creature that's already drained doesn't restore any HP to the vampire, but it increases the creature's drained condition value by 1. A vrykolakas can also consume blood that's been emptied into a vessel for sustenance, but it gains no HP from doing so.  \n  \n The target creature's drained condition value decreases by 1 per week. A blood transfusion, which requires a successful DC 20 Medicine check and sufficient blood or a blood donor, reduces the drained value by 1 after 10 minutes.   \n  \n**Rend** [#] The vrykolakas gains the Rend action with its claws.",

Creatures of 9th level or higher can become a vrykolakas master, while those of 12th level or higher who have survived for centuries might become a vrykolakas ancient.   \n  \n**Children of the Night** (divine, enchantment, mental) The presence of a vrykolakas master inspires savage creatures to crawl forth to do its bidding, including rat swarms, warg, werewolves, and similar creatures. The vrykolakas master can give telepathic orders to these creatures within 100 feet, but they can't communicate back.   \n  \n**Pestilential Aura** (aura, divine, necromancy) 5 feet. Creatures beginning their turn in the area while the vrykolakas is in its true form are exposed to bubonic plague.   \n  \n**Divine Innate Spells** The vrykolakas master can cast *vampiric touch* (heightened to half its level rounded up) and 3rd-level fear three times per day each as divine innate spells. It uses a high DC for its level.   \n  \n**Bubonic Plague** (disease) **Saving Throw** Fortitude (use a high DC for the vrykolakas's level); **Onset** 1 day; **Stage 1** fatigued (1 day); **Stage 2** enfeebled 2 and fatigued (1 day); Stage 3 enfeebled 3, fatigued, and takes 1d6 persistent bleed damage every 1d20 minutes (1 day)   \n  \n**Change Shape** [#] (concentrate, divine, polymorph, transmutation) A vrykolakas master can transform into a form resembling the body it had in life, with the effects of *humanoid form* but with unlimited duration. It loses its fangs and claw Strikes but gains a +2 circumstance bonus to Deception checks to Impersonate in this form.   \n  \n**Create Spawn** (divine, downtime, necromancy) If a creature dies after being reduced to 0 HP by Drink Blood, a vrykolakas master can turn this creature into a vrykolakas spawn by donating some of its own blood to the creature and burying it in earth for 3 nights. Such vrykolakas spawn are generally friendly to the vrykolakas that created them, but they are not under its control and typically wander off on their own rampage within 1d6 days of their creation. **Dominate Animal** [#] (divine, enchantment, incapacitation, mental) The vrykolakas can cast *dominate* at will as a divine innate spell that affects only animals. The save DC is a high DC for the vrykolakas's level, and a creature that succeeds is immune to that vrykolakas's Dominate Animal for 24 hours. Destroying the vrykolakas ends the effect, but reducing it to 0 HP does not.

Instead, it attempts to cast its spirit into an animal within 100 feet, which must attempt a Will save (DC 24). On a failure, the animal is possessed. This has the effects of the *possession* spell, but it lasts a number of days equal to the vrykolakas's level. This possession can't be counteracted with magic (though *remove curse* works against it normally). If the animal succeeds at its save, the vrykolakas can attempt to possess a different animal within 100 feet. If at any point an animal critically succeeds at its save or no animal is within 100 feet, the vrykolakas fails to possess anything and is destroyed. A vrykolakas possessing an animal seeks out its burial site (see Burial Site Bound) immediately, burying itself there. While the vrykolakas is in this state of recovery, its animal host is paralyzed, and beheading it destroys the vrykolakas and kills its host. Removing the curse destroys the vrykolakas and returns the animal to normal. After 1d4 days, if the vrykolakas hasn't been destroyed, the animal dies and the vrykolakas rises in a new body that's identical to its previous one, formed from the animal's remains.",

While possessing a target, a possessor's true body is unconscious (and can't wake up normally), unless the possession effect allows the creature to physically enter the target. Whenever the target takes damage, the possessor takes half that amount of damage as mental damage.  \n  \n A possessor loses the benefits of any of its active spells or abilities that affect its physical body, though it gains the benefits of the target's active spells and abilities that affect their body. A possessor can use any of the target's abilities that are purely physical, and it can't use any of its own abilities except spells and purely mental abilities. The GM decides whether an ability is purely physical or purely mental. A possessor uses the target's attack modifier, AC, Fortitude save, Reflex save, Perception, and physical skills, and its own Will save, mental skills, spell attack roll, and spell DC; benefits of invested items apply where relevant (the possessor's invested items apply when using its own values, and the target's invested items apply when using the target's values). A possessor gains no benefit from casting spells that normally affect only the caster, since it isn't in its own body.  \n  \n The possessor must use its own actions to make the possessed creature act.  \n  \n If a possessor reaches 0 Hit Points through any combination of damage to its true body and mental damage from the possession, it is knocked out as normal and the possession immediately ends. If the target reaches 0 Hit Points first, the possessor can either fall unconscious with the body and continue the possession or end the effect as a free action and return to its body. If the target dies, the possession ends immediately and the possessor is stunned for 1 minute.",

On a success, the creature becomes drained 1, and the vrykolakas regains 10 HP, gaining any excess HP as temporary Hit Points. Drinking Blood from a creature that's already drained doesn't restore any HP to the vampire, but it increases the creature's drained condition value by 1. A vrykolakas can also consume blood that's been emptied into a vessel for sustenance, but it gains no HP from doing so.  \n The target creature's drained condition value decreases by 1 per week. A blood transfusion, which requires a successful DC 20 Medicine check and sufficient blood or a blood donor, reduces the drained value by 1 after 10 minutes."

When they gather in sufficient numbers to swarm, they eschew the stealth of a lone leech's feeding methods in favor of swift and merciless feeding. In these situations, their mild venom can affect much larger creatures than their usual prey.",

But it's the relatively small gutleech that provides the most fuel for nightmares, due to its awful habit of feeding on victims from inside.",

Only once one draws closer\u2014 once whip-like tentacles dripping with flesh-rotting venom slither out from the fungus's cratered cap\u2014does the terrifying truth of this carnivorous toadstool become apparent. Many amateur spelunkers have met untimely ends in the clutches of this monstrous fungus's tentacles, since violet fungi are practically synonymous with caverns on Golarion.  \n  \n Anyone who has ever braved the world's caves for an extended period of time know the dangers of the deadly violet fungus. Darklands dwellers such as drow and duergars often bear the long, whip-like scars of at least one brush with this vicious plant's cruel, poison-infused tentacles. Canny subterranean trappers and scouts sometimes make use of cultivated violent fungi to catch game in the enormous caverns below the surface world. Some Darklands peoples also cultivate violet fungi as a means to defend their territory. Xulgaths in particular place violet fungi around the perimeters of their settlements as a first line of defense.",

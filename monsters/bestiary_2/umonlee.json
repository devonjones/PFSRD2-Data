As such, there are stories of youths, gnomes, or other small-statured creatures who encounter umonlees in the wild and manage to befriend them, so that at some later point in the tale when the pint-sized protagonists are in peril, their enormous ally can arrive, bursting from a nearby glacier to play the role of overwhelming savior. Whether or not these tales have any basis in truth is unknown.",

            "text": "Those who dwell in the coldest climates of Golarion tell of a brutal beast that swims through the ice and snow and can devastate entire villages in minutes. Ancient Erutaki who made their homes in the frozen polar expanse called the Crown of the World named this monster the umonlee.  \n  \n Umonlees are bestial predators who constantly hunt, rarely resting in service of a hunger that is never fully sated. Despite this animalistic drive, umonlees are semi-intelligent creatures who often select and stalk their prey. However, they are not terribly bright and often keep their hunting grounds in sparsely-trafficked areas. It is rare for an umonlee to attack a village, but one might attack a sparse group, such as a hunting or scouting party. Many caravans traversing the Path of Aganhei\u2014the trade route between the continents of Avistan and Tian Xia that crosses the Crown of the World\u2014have had their expeditions abruptly ended by an encounter with one of these monstrosities.  \n  \n Those who study monsters posit that umonlees are related to chuuls, as the creatures exhibit some similarities. Both are semi-intelligent, crustacean predators that use ambush tactics to kill and eat their prey. Even though they can talk, umonlees typically only speak Aklo, which also gives credence to this theory. This would also lend to the theory that chuuls are products of alghollthu manipulation, meaning that umonlees are also the results of these alien designs. However, the fact that these creatures aren't evil argues well against such a theory.",

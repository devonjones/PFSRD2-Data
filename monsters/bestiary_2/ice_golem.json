Unless it is in a freezing environment, the golem's shattered remains soon melt completely away. Still, the animating magic can linger in shards of ice that resist melting; these may fetch a good price from wealthy folk to preserve foods or chill beverages. Pieces of ice that are captured and magically preserved or allowed to melt in sealed containers can also be sold to scholars who may be able to divine arcane secrets from the once magically animated materials.",

In most cases, the resulting shape is little more than a crude approximation of a humanoid form, but given the right talent, an ice golem could be an exquisitely carved statue of a mythical creature, famous persona, or even a deity.  \n  \n While ice golems most frequently serve as guardians in freezing climates, the magic that holds an ice golem together keeps it from melting in warmer temperatures. This, combined with the fact that ice golems lie on the lower end of the scale as far as cost and difficulty to create, gives these constructs unusual features that puts them in great demand. The rich and powerful in hot, arid regions often commission ice golems not only as guardians for their estates and vaults, but for comfort\u2014the presence of an ice golem standing quietly sentinel in the corner of a room can help to keep the chamber at a comfortable temperature. The truly decadent use ice golems as servants to keep drinks cold.",

            "text": "Crafted of base materials and then magically animated into a powerful guardian, the legendary golem is a living construct that mindlessly obeys its creator's commands\u2014 often continuing to do so for years or even centuries after its creator's death. There exist two known methods of animating a golem. The traditional method involves harvesting and implanting an elemental soul or essence within the newly crafted host statue, a procedure seen as vile and blasphemous to those who value the sanctity of the soul; evil or amoral golem crafters tend to prefer this method. The other, less disreputable technique involves siphoning pure positive energy into the statue to artificially imitate the creation of a soul. The result does not give the golem a true soul and is generally a more costly and time-consuming method of creation. Regardless of the method used, the resulting golem functions the same. A golem's unique animating force leaves it susceptible to certain forms of magic, but apart from these few weaknesses, it is impervious to magic and difficult to damage with weapons.  \n  \n Golems work best in play as foes to vanquish rather than allies to accompany player characters on adventures. The process of creating a golem is time-consuming, expensive, and difficult, and only the most talented spellcasters or artisans can even hope to accomplish such an undertaking. While certain magical texts\u2014so-called \u201cgolem manuals\u201d\u2014are said to aid golems crafters, for the most part the creation of a golem should be something left in the hands of the Game Master.  \n  \n Golems have components that can be harvested as trophies or magical components; the value depends on the golem in question. Examples of components that can be harvested from golems are listed in the sidebars.",

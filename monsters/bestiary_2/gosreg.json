They act as spies and special forces that can mingle with humanoid society while enacting plans for the rest of the Dominion in secret.  \n  \n In their natural forms, gosregs dart about in a jerky gallop due to their stumpy legs and gangly arms. They take on the appearances of humanoids to infiltrate societies, and they drop their disguises only when they feel they are ultimately compromised and must resort to physical violence to protect their agendas. Their brain-like heads and bestial legs suggest a potential link with a similar Dominion of the Black agent: the dreaded intellect devourer.",

Unless otherwise noted, the battle form prevents you from casting spells, speaking, and using most manipulate actions that require hands.

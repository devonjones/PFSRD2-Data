These sorcerers clashed often against various wizardly guilds who held power throughout the various regions of Azlant, and intended for leydroths to serve as weapons of terror against their foes. Today, leydroths remain isolated on certain particularly dangerous islands among the remnants of the shattered continent of Azlant, but now and then foolish explorers seek to transport them back to the mainland.",

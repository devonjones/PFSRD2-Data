While they could easily live off of the minerals and tiny organisms they filter from the water sucked through their ventral tubes, they delight in killing living creatures. Despite their cruel natures, quoppopaks don't mind hunting alongside others of their kind if it means they'll be able to create even more carnage.",

Their bodies consist of an oval abdomen, eight hollow tentacles, and a thick, tail-like limb ending in a ventral tube, which resembles a lamprey's mouth and is capable of intaking fluids at an astounding rate. While quoppopaks can clumsily maneuver on land, they prefer to move on water; quoppopaks glide along the surface of lakes or the ocean by thrusting their ventral tubes into the water, cycling liquid up through their bodies, then spraying the water back out in a high-pressure stream through their hollow, spear-like tentacles. Though the ventral tube can't expel fluids, it still poses a substantial threat to other creatures. Quoppopaks have gills, but they are located inside the creatures' abdomens, allowing them to draw their air from the water they siphon through their ventral tubes. Quoppopaks can hold some water in their abdomens for quick forays on land, but this is akin to humans holding their breath to go underwater, and the monsters' water reserves quickly deplete.",

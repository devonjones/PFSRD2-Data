Unless otherwise stated, polymorph spells don't allow the target to take on the appearance of a specific individual creature, but rather just a generic creature of a general type or ancestry.  \n  \n If you take on a battle form with a polymorph spell, the special statistics can be adjusted only by circumstance bonuses, status bonuses, and penalties. Unless otherwise noted, the battle form prevents you from casting spells, speaking, and using most manipulate actions that require hands. (If there's doubt about whether you can use an action, the GM decides.) Your gear is absorbed into you; the constant abilities of your gear still function, but you can't activate any items.",

On a success, the victim becomes drained 1 and the baobhan sith regains 10 HP, gaining any Hit Points in excess of their maximum Hit Points as temporary Hit Points. Drinking Blood from a victim that's already drained doesn't restore any Hit Points to the baobhan sith but increases the victim's drained value by 1. A victim's drained condition decreases by 1 per week. A blood transfusion, which requires 10 minutes, a successful DC 20 Medicine check, and sufficient blood or a blood donor, reduces the drained value by 1."

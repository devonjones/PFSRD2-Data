            "text": "Gripplis make their homes in the treetops of tropical jungles and forests. These frog-like humanoids are uniquely adapted to their environment, with oversized eyes that give them keen vision in both light and dark and large toes that allow them to easily scale trees. Gripplis vary widely in physical appearance, with their physiologies influenced by their surrounding environment. Those who live in verdant forests, for example, typically have bright green skin and red eyes. In contrast, gripplis who live in regions of rot and decay have mottled-brown coloration, and those who dwell near lakes or streams may bear bright blue and orange stripes. Typical gripplis stand just over 2 feet tall and weigh approximately 30 pounds.  \n  \n Whatever region they come from, gripplis tend to be peaceful hunter-gatherers. Due to their modest understanding of agriculture, gripplis don't maintain typical farms like other humanoids do. Rather, they cultivate mushroom patches and gather a wide array of fruits from the surrounding wilderness. While most gripplis hunt insects, some societies also capture and breed them, nurturing herds of giant dragonflies or beetles that they eventually slaughter for food. Particularly enterprising gripplis might even seek out and tame larger flying insects to use as mounts during their hunts. The rearing of such massive insects is no easy feat, however, so gripplis who manage to do so are often heralded as local heroes.  \n  \n Gripplis usually construct their villages in particularly dense copses, stringing thin rope bridges between wide wooden platforms built around each trunk. They make use of broad leaves and thick branches to further obscure their villages, making them especially difficult to spot from the forest floor, and riddle the surrounding forest with labyrinthine trails that only they can navigate.  \n  \n Grippli scouts typically keep watch on the outskirts of grippli settlements. More potent gripplis inhabit the settlements, be they religious leaders, powerful druids, or agile warriors that, due to their small size, focus more on finesse weapons and ranged attacks than on melee tactics.",

Due to their modest understanding of agriculture, gripplis don\u2019t raise crops in the traditional sense, although they do cultivate mushroom patches and gather a wide array of fruits from the surrounding wilderness. The jungle also contains rivers and lakes filled with silver-scaled fish, which gripplis harvest in a sustainable manner to ensure their future supply, as well as fatty insects that grow much larger than in other parts of the world. Some of the most advanced grippli societies capture and breed these insects, nurturing herds of giant dragonflies or beetles that are eventually slaughtered for food for the rest of the village. Particularly enterprising gripplis even seek out and tame huge flying insects to use as mounts during their hunts. The rearing of such massive insects is no easy feat, however, so gripplis who manage to do so are often heralded as local heroes.  \n  \n The treetop settlements of the grippli are difficult to spot from the forest floor. Gripplis obscure their holdings with broad leaves and thick branches, and they riddle the surrounding forest with labyrinthine trails that only they know how to navigate. Their villages are usually constructed among the densest populations of trees, with thin rope bridges strung between wide wooden platforms built around each trunk.",

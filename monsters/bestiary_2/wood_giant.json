Wood giants are patient and kind to those who show respect and care for wild places. Although most wood giants consider civilization as simply another part of the world, they value places untouched by permanent structures and dense humanoid settlements.  \n  \n Wood giants have long, drooping ears and more slender builds than most giants. Despite their size, they are graceful and agile, able to move through dense forests and brush with little sound. They have been known to work closely with druids and others who share their respect for the sanctity of wilderness regions. Wood giants spend their days patrolling vast swaths of territory, foraging, and keeping an eye out for any who would despoil their lands. While they respect the connection to nature they share with many fey creatures and remain on good terms with them, wood giants see most fey as far too flighty to take part in any long-term plans.  \n  \n An average wood giant stands 14 feet tall and weighs 1,200 pounds.",

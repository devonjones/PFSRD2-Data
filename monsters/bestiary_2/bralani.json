Speed often features somewhere in bralani games, whether it be physical speed or quickness of wit. It is not uncommon for bralanis to seek the input of young children, encouraging adults to draw inspiration from a child's creativity rather than allowing themselves to settle into comfortable and repetitive patterns.",

While all azatas cherish freedom, each type exemplifies a particular freedom above others. Many of their kind hold strange knightly and courtly titles that defy mortal classification and shift and change with time and on different occasions rather than following a strict hierarchy. This baffles archon and other more lawful creatures who haven't had much contact with azatas. In actuality, the azatas use their titles as personal flourishes and points of pride, rather than as excuses to order each other around.",

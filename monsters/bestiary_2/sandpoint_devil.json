Most hold that it's the fantasy of simple folk and booze-filled bellies, but locals insist it exists. Other creatures akin to the Sandpoint Devil might exist elsewhere in the world, with slight variations on their innate spells and the nature of their Accursed Breath.",

It has the hooves and body of a powerful horse, but it walks on its hind legs in a perverse parody of a humanoid gait. Its equine face has been distorted and elongated with skeletal, yellowed fangs and milky eyes. The pox-spotted hide along the creature's back bears a draconic tail with dark, spiny plates and two torn, bat-like wings.  \n  \n The legendary Sandpoint Devil appears only on moonless nights when mists gather around the coast. Most encounters end with missing livestock or children, with little left behind other than oddly placed hoofprints that reek of brimstone.",

Although peludas rarely have any actual affection for such servants, they revel in the submission of these weaker creatures and the gifts of gold and food they bring.",

            "text": "Peludas are wild and savage dragons that favor reedy marshlands, sparsely forested bogs, and river valleys for lairs. A single peluda typically claims a stretch of waterways a few miles in length, then systematically drives off any potential rivals so that the peluda can despoil the land as they please, leaving clawed footprints on muddy riverbanks, toppling trees, and impaling half-eaten corpses on their quills as trophies left to rot. They venture beyond their domains to hunt, roasting prey with their breath or pulverizing them with their tails, burning and killing for cruel sport before slithering, sated, back to their mucky lairs.  \n  \n Peludas despise weakness and loathe creatures smaller than themselves, especially humanoids, whom they see as fragile and soft, good only for eating or breaking. In contrast, peludas have a massive inferiority complex regarding more impressive creatures\u2014especially larger and stronger dragons. Peludas will try anything to become stronger, including ingesting shiny coins, gems, and jewelry, which old folk tales claim will strengthen their quills and fire breath.",

Totenmaskes' specific longings vary\u2014one might be obsessed with food or drink, while another might be vain and desirous of an attractive form to marvel at in a mirror, while yet another could simply long for the scent of blood. Whatever the sensation the totenmaske seeks, it is always a vice taken to extreme, for this sin is what helped condemn it to unlife in the first place. A totenmaske obsessed with food, for example, might find itself assaulting bakeries or breweries, while a vain totenmaske obsessed with glamor could quickly grow bored of each new look and switch its victims out daily, or even hourly.",

The target can attempt a DC 25 Fortitude save to resist; a critical success grants temporary immunity to Shape Flesh for 24 hours. Each time the totenmaske Shapes Flesh, it chooses one feature: ears (target becomes deafened), eyes (target becomes blinded), mouth (target can't speak or eat), or nose (target can't smell). A creature with both its nose and mouth sealed can't breathe and begins to suffocate. Changes are permanent until reversed by removing this curse, or the sealed flesh can be surgically opened with a DC 25 Medicine check that takes 1d4 rounds and deals 1d6 slashing damage per round."

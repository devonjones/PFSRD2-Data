Star archons burn with the glory and intensity of a sun, and their sense of duty and desire to defeat evil are as indefatigable as the light of the stars. While their dazzling intellects and unmatched strategic cunning make them most useful in war rooms rather than on battlefields, star archons are fierce opponents when motivated to enter the fray. Those who witness the self-sacrifice of a star archon and live to tell the tale describe the experience in terms that might befit the sight of a supernova at the instant the star collapses in on itself.",

They're usually more interested in defending territory than killing intruders, and they won't pursue victims for long if they flee.",

They have little need to eat, but without a constant source of moisture, a mudwretch dries out, suffering from low throbbing aches until it can resaturate. Often, blood from living creatures has to do\u2014a dried mudwretch is more dangerous to intruders than one that's comfortably wallowing on a river bank.",

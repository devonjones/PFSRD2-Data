This filament resembles a semi-transparent <a aonid=\"44\" game-obj=\"Equipment\">silk rope</a> and is coated with an adhesive that traps prey that comes in contact with it. When reeling in its prey, the cave fisher consumes the filament as well, slurping it up like a noodle.<br/><br/> A severed filament can be harvested for use as rope. The adhesive dries after about 10 minutes. A harvested filament gland can't produce new filaments, but it can be used as 25 gp worth of raw materials for creating potent adhesives, such as sovereign glue.",

When it does, the cave fisher excretes thin, tough, and very sticky filaments at its prey with lightning speed to capture it.<br/><br/>A cave fisher eats just about any live prey smaller than itself, though anything smaller than a rat isn't much of a meal for it. When a cave fisher captures such a creature, it often leaves the hapless animal entangled, using it as bait to attract larger creatures. Because the adhesive on its filament doesn't last long, the fisher frequently needs to eat one filament and excrete a new one. The filaments are translucent and can be hard to see when they're still and in darkness.<br/><br/>Cave fishers hatch with the ability to excrete filaments, but they molt many times before reaching their adult size of about 7 feet long and 400 pounds. They often leave shed shells in conspicuous locations as decoys.<br/><br/><b><u><a aonid=\"5\" game-obj=\"Skills\" general=\"true\">Recall Knowledge - Animal</a></u> (<u><a aonid=\"10\" game-obj=\"Skills\">Nature</a></u>)</b>: DC 16",

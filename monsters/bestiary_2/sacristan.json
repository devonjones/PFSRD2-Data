Sacristans are empowered by a miniature gateway to the Shadow Plane deep in their mouths. By distending their jaws, they can howl with the shrieks and windstorms of that plane. Sacristans vary in appearance but are the size of maimed humans. Their features are redundant or absent and they are wrapped in barbed and rusted chains.",

The subsumed creature's dying value does not increase, though it can't decrease either. Tyrroicese regains 30 HP and also gains the ability to use one or two of the subsumed creature's special abilities or feats, subject to the GM's discretion. A creature adjacent to Tyrroicese can extract a subsumed creature by spending 2 actions to attempt a DC 29 Athletics check. On a success, the subsumed creature is pulled from Tyrroicese and falls into the nearest available space."

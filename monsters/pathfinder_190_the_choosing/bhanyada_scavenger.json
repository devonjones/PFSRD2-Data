Plainly amalgamations of meat and gristle, few of which appear in the same color or texture, bhanyada scavengers have a horrifying mottled appearance. Their bulbous heads split into a maw with blunt teeth that shift about within their mouths to grind food. Bhanyada scavengers prefer living prey and usually hunt in numbers, often following in the wake of bhanyada behemoths to snatch up any scraps left behind.",

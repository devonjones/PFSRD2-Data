Scrapborn sometimes result from this strange convergence.  \n  \n Mostly, scrapborn appear to be walking piles of assorted junk, seemingly assembled at random. Their actual bodies are vaguely humanoid with delicate, spongy green skin. They secrete an adhesive that allows them to gather up debris and attach it to their bodies for protection. When these scraps eventually fall off, the scrapborn either reattaches them or replaces them with something new. Despite their resulting bulky appearance, scrapborn remain strong swimmers and display little loss of agility underwater.  \n  \n Scrapborn lack a centralized society, but sometimes congregate in small groups that work together for survival. Typically, this leads to ever-escalating attacks on nearby settlements as the creatures feed upon each other's resentment and work themselves up into a frenzy. They often target places with high-quality armor first so they can improve their odds of survival.",

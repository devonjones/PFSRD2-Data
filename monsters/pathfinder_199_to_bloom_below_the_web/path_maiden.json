This resistance increases to 10 at 9th level and 15 at 16th level.  \n  \n **Imprisoning Grave** (aura, divine, necromancy) 30 feet. The soul of a creature that dies within the path maiden's aura is trapped within its corpse until its body spends 1 minute outside the aura. While trapped, the soul can't move on to the afterlife but can still be brought back to life or transformed into an undead creature.  \n  \n **Limited Flight** A path maiden has a fly Speed equal to her Speed but can't fly higher than 10 feet above the ground, and if she ends her turn above a nonsolid surface, she vanishes and rematerializes on the last space she occupied over solid ground and becomes stunned 1.  \n  \n **Apostate's Shroud** All path maidens have an apostate's shroud unarmed attack that deals mental damage. This attack, which manifests as a whipping lash from the path maiden's sleeves or hem, has the agile, finesse, and magical traits. A creature damaged by this attack must succeed at a Fortitude save against the path maiden's spell DC. On a failure, the creature becomes cursed for 1 hour; if the creature dies while cursed, it immediately rises from death as a ghost. If the creature is a lower level than the path maiden that cursed it, it treats that path maiden as an ally and loyally obeys her; otherwise, it manifests as a free-willed ghost. In either case, it becomes site bound to the site of their death.  \n  \n **Occult Innate Spells** All path maidens have a limited selection of occult innate spells. A typical path maiden has six innate spells\u2014two of a spell level equal to their actual level divided by 2 (rounded down), and then two more for the next two spell levels below that. In addition, all path maidens have the following cantrips (cast at a level equal to their highest-level innate spell): dancing lights, ghost sound, know direction, mage hand, and telekinetic projectile. The path maiden's spell DC and spell attack use high values.",

On a failure, the amount of Hit Points restored by the spell or ability is halved. On a critical failure, the positive energy becomes negative energy, harming a living target instead of healing it.  \n  \n Corrupting Doubt (emotion, enchantment, mental, occult) A creature damaged by the path maiden's hand Strike must succeed at a Will save to avoid becoming slowed 1 for 1 round (slowed 2 on a critical failure).  \n  \n Scorn Fate [##] (curse, divination, misfortune, occult) The path maiden targets a creature she can see. The creature must attempt a Will save against the path maiden's spell DC. On a failure, the creature's next roll is cursed. If the result of the roll is a critical success, it becomes a regular success. A success becomes a failure, and a failure becomes a critical failure.

On a failure, its next roll to attack the path maiden must be rolled twice, and it takes the worse result.

The target must attempt a Will save against the path maiden's spell DC.

On a failure, the creature becomes cursed for 1 hour; if the creature dies while cursed, it immediately rises from death as a ghost. If the creature is a lower level than the path maiden that cursed it, it treats that path maiden as an ally and loyally obeys her; otherwise, it manifests as a free-willed ghost.

A curse either lasts a specified amount of time or can be removed only by certain actions a character must perform or conditions they must meet. A curse with stages follows the rules for afflictions.

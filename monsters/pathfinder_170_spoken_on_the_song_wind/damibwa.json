Never truly wild in temperament, feral damibwas have a friendly disposition and bond easily with humanoids and other canines.",

            "text": "Damibwas are domesticated hounds capable of detecting prey or predators via echolocation thanks to their exceptionally large ears and keen hearing. Adept swimmers, damibwas have sleek bodies, short limbs, webbed feet, and long muscular tails that enable them to maneuver underwater with grace and speed.  \n  \n Trained as specialized hunting hounds, damibwas primarily catch fish, although they're also adept at diving for lobsters, crabs, and clams. While hunting, damibwas wait near the water's edge, typically on a boat or along the shore, listening for choice prey. When they detect prey in range, they dive down below the water, catch the animal in their jaws, and drag it back up to the surface. When large or dangerous aquatic predators approach, damibwas retreat to land and howl a warning, making them desirable guard dogs in coastal or riverside communities. Damibwas rarely attack terrestrial creatures unless they're threatened and unable to make an escape.  \n  \n Damibwas are popular pets along rivers, lakes, and swamps throughout Golarion, particularly in the River Kingdoms, Wanshou, and the canals of Nantambu in the Mwangi Expanse. Some Erutaki in Avistan's far north hunt seals alongside a particular hardy breed covered in thick fur and a layer of blubber. They are only universally called damibwas in the Mwangi Expanse, and are often called \u201cdiving dogs\u201d in other regions.",

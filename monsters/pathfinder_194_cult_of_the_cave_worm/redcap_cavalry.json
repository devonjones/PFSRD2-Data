Although a flying cavalry was Queen Frilogarma's goal, her court ended up accidentally inventing redcap racing. In this sport, one redcap with a freshly soaked cap is swung around a racetrack by a giant arm while several other redcaps on giant bloodseekers fly after them. The \u201cbait\u201d redcap doesn't usually survive, but they are the center of attention for about two minutes.",

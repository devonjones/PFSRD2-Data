This comes at a cost: all caligni assassins eventually succumb to an affliction known as shadowfade. This magical malady causes the caligni's body to painfully warp when concealed in shadows, as the plane's ability to create twisted reflections of reality changes their physical form directly.  \n  \n Sometimes a caligni assassin will flee home and strike out on their own to avoid becoming a twisted tool for their greedy leaders. Such freelancers are in high demand for those seeking a fatal solution to their own political problems.",

The greatest irony of the caligni's bargain is that the Forsaken themselves mysteriously vanished long ago and no longer answer pleas or prayers. Today, caligni still burst into light upon death, but their soul energy no longer feeds a mysterious pantheon of shadowy divinities.",

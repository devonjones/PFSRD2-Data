It is theorized that these cave worms hatched near the corpses of thousands of graves, perhaps deep in the layers of the Darklands that once held large populations at the moment of Starfall. The negative energy associated with the collective extinction of so much life has warped these worms so that they embody the misery and death caused by the cataclysm. They are unique among cave worms in that they prefer not to swallow prey alive, but to eat only dead flesh.",

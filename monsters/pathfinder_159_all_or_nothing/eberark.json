Commonly called flint beasts, eberarks drag their overlarge claws (four on each paw) along the ground as they move, creating showers of sparks with every grating step. Incredibly vain, eberarks relish displaying their dominance over other intelligent beings. Some eberarks conquer small settlements, demanding tribute from residents and travelers, or lead bands of violent brigands.",

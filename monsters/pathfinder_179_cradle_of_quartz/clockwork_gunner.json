Not all require daily winding, but those that do have the wind-up ability in their stat blocks.  \n  \n__Wind-Up__: To remain operational, a clockwork vehicle or creature must be wound with a unique key by a creature. This takes an amount of time listed in the clockwork's wind-up entry, which also lists how long the clockwork remains operational once wound; after this duration, the clockwork becomes inactive and immobile until it's wound again. Some clockworks' abilities require them to spend some of their remaining operational time. They can't spend more than they have and shut down immediately once they have 0 time remaining. If it's unclear when a clockwork was last wound, most are re-wound approximately halfway through their operating time.  \n  \n A clockwork vehicle can be placed into standby mode by its pilot as a 3-action activity; a clockwork creature must perform this activity itself. A clockwork's operational time doesn't decrease in standby.  \n  \n A creature can attempt to Disable a Device to wind a clockwork down (with a DC listed in the wind-up entry).",

If you choose to use one of them, it replaces the melee usage's normal critical specialization effect.  \n  \n First, if the ranged weapon is a firearm, you can discharge it to create a loud bang and concussion, using the critical specialization effect for firearms instead of the melee weapon group's critical specialization effect. Second, you can choose to discharge the ranged weapon to increase the critical hit's momentum or shoot the foe as you attack in melee, dealing 2 additional damage per weapon damage die. Both of these options discharge the ranged weapon, which typically means you have to reload it before firing it again.",

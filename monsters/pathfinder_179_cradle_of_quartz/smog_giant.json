For all their physical abnormalities, it's still fair to say the violent confrontations common along the Western Ravage are the true cause of smog giants' monstrous nature.  \n  \n Smog giants can eat meat and bone, but they prefer diets of black powder and the raw materials that make up this alchemical concoction. Their bodies store repositories of the stuff infused with the unstable occult energies that lace their flesh, granting them the ability to \u201ccrack\u201d these pockets of subdermal explosives when they attack, much like a tough cracking their knuckles during a fight. In this case however, the results are much more violent\u2014especially when coupled with the large quantities of weaponized body piercings and adornments smog giants often wear.",

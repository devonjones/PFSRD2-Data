The damage increases to 2d6 if the mutant is at least 8th level and 3d6 if the mutant is at least 15th level.<br/><br/><b>Chameleon Skin</b> The mutant can change their coloration to match their surroundings. They don't need <a aonid=\"459\" game-obj=\"Rules\">cover</a> or <a aonid=\"4\" game-obj=\"Conditions\">concealment</a> to attempt to <a aonid=\"62\" game-obj=\"Actions\">Hide</a> with a <a aonid=\"15\" game-obj=\"Skills\">Stealth</a> check.<br/><br/><b>Eldritch Attraction</b> (<a aonid=\"61\" game-obj=\"Traits\">enchantment</a>, <a aonid=\"106\" game-obj=\"Traits\">mental</a>) A creature who casts a spell within 30 feet of the mutant must succeed at a Will save or spend its next action to Stride toward the mutant.

Choose whether the mutant creates a 60-foot line of energy or a 30-foot cone of energy when they activate this ability. The energy deals 1d6 damage per level with a <a aonid=\"329\" game-obj=\"Rules\">basic</a> Reflex save. The mutant can't use Energy Blast again for 1d4 rounds.<br/><br/><b>Energy Resistance</b> The mutant has strangely colored skin or fur and gains resistance to a single type of energy damage. The amount of energy resistance gained depends on the mutant's level.<tableshtml><br/><br/> <b>Grasping Tentacle</b> The mutant grows a writhing, serpentine appendage, granting them a tentacle Strike (an <a aonid=\"170\" game-obj=\"Traits\">agile</a> <a aonid=\"199\" game-obj=\"Traits\">unarmed</a> attack that deals bludgeoning damage), and the <a aonid=\"18\" game-obj=\"MonsterAbilities\">Grab</a> ability with that Strike. If they had any agile attacks, the damage dealt by their tentacle should be roughly the same as the damage dealt by those attacks. If they had only non-agile attacks, their tentacle should deal three-quarters that damage.<br/><br/> <b>Hulking Form</b> Increase the mutant's size by one category. Decrease their AC by 1, increase their HP by 1/10 their normal maximum HP, and increase the <a aonid=\"192\" game-obj=\"Traits\">reach</a> of all their melee Strikes by 5 feet.<br/><br/> <b>Hungry Maw</b> A mouth full of razor-sharp teeth opens somewhere on the mutant's body. They gain a maw Strike (an unarmed attack that does piercing damage roughly the same as the damage dealt by their most damaging melee attack), and they gain the Vengeful Bite reaction.<br/> <b>Vengeful Bite</b> <span aria-label=\"Reaction\" class=\"action action-4\" role=\"img\" title=\"Reaction\"> </span> <b>Trigger</b> A creature critically hits the mutant with a melee <a aonid=\"199\" game-obj=\"Traits\">unarmed</a> Strike or a non-<a aonid=\"192\" game-obj=\"Traits\">reach</a> melee <b>Strike</b>; Effect The mutant makes a maw Strike against the triggering creature.<br/><br/> <b>Increased Speed</b> The mutant's limbs change, or they grow new limbs to accommodate their mutation. Either one of their existing Speeds increases by 20 feet or they gain a new Speed (such as fly or swim) of 15 feet.<br/><br/> <b>Magic Hunger</b> The mutant gains the ability to detect the source of any magic within 30 feet as an imprecise sense.<br/><br/> <b>Mirror Thing</b> <span aria-label=\"Single Action\" class=\"action action-1\" role=\"img\" title=\"Single Action\"> </span>  (<a aonid=\"11\" game-obj=\"Traits\">arcane</a>, <a aonid=\"32\" game-obj=\"Traits\">concentrate</a>, <a aonid=\"127\" game-obj=\"Traits\">polymorph</a>, <a aonid=\"157\" game-obj=\"Traits\">transmutation</a>) The mutant takes on the specific appearance of any Small or Medium <a aonid=\"91\" game-obj=\"Traits\">humanoid</a> they can currently see. This doesn't alter their statistics, but it might change the damage type of their Strikes.<br/><br/> <b>Revolting Appearance</b> (<a aonid=\"11\" game-obj=\"Traits\">arcane</a>, <a aonid=\"206\" game-obj=\"Traits\">aura</a>, <a aonid=\"163\" game-obj=\"Traits\">visual</a>) Details of the mutant's appearance are disturbing and unnatural in the extreme.

A creature who succeeds at its save is then temporarily immune to the aura for 24 hours.<br/><br/> <b>Sprouted Limb</b> The mutant grows an extra leg, increasing their Speed by 10 feet.<br/><br/> <b>Too Many Eyes</b> Countless eyes sprout on the mutant's skin.

That Strike now inflicts a <a aonid=\"46\" game-obj=\"Traits\">disease</a>, <a aonid=\"126\" game-obj=\"Traits\">poison</a>, or similar affliction on a hit, with a Fortitude save to resist. You can use the rules for existing monsters of the mutant's level for diseases, poisons, and similar afflictions to give to your mutant, or you can simply say the strike inflicts an additional 1d6 poison damage + an additional 1d6 points per 4 mutant levels on a hit, with a <a aonid=\"329\" game-obj=\"Rules\">basic</a> Fortitude save. This makes the Strike significantly more deadly, so reduce the damage in other ways to account for this increase. <br/><br/><b>Energy Resistance</b> The mutant has strangely colored skin or fur and gains resistance to a single type of energy damage.

The energy deals 1d6 damage per level with a <a aonid=\"329\" game-obj=\"Rules\">basic</a> Reflex save. The mutant can't use Energy Blast again for 1d4 rounds. <br/><br/><b>Inoculation</b> The mutant's flesh is distorted with the addition of unexpected fur, scales, warts, or other growths. The creature gains a +2 status bonus to saves against <a aonid=\"46\" game-obj=\"Traits\">disease</a> and <a aonid=\"126\" game-obj=\"Traits\">poison</a>. In rare cases, you might choose to grant immunity instead. <br/><br/><b>Increased Speed</b> The mutant's limbs change, or it grows new limbs to accommodate its mutation.

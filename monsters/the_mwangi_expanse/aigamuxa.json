            "text": "Aigamuxas are towering humanoids that stalk arid deserts in search of prey. Carnivorous and voracious, they hunt anything that moves but especially relish eating sentient creatures. Many Mwangi people incorrectly refer to aigamuxas as demons, while others more accurately describe them as having descended from giants. Aigamuxas resemble large humans with smooth hollows where their eyes should be, but their eyes are actually embedded in the soles of their feet. They sport long, sharp claws and teeth that they use to tear their prey apart once they catch them. A moving aigamuxa's odd gait resembles dancing more than a typical walk or run, but its speed is alarming, if difficult to correctly estimate at a distance.  \n  \n An aigamuxa's unique physiology makes catching prey difficult, and most aigamuxas are constantly hungry. When pursuing prey, an aigamuxa must occasionally stop to lift its feet in order to regain their bearings. Most stand on their hands while looking around, which allows them to immediately backflip back into a run. An aigamuxa's eyes are generally resistant to the sands of their native desert habitats, but irritants such as chilies or caltrops can seriously impair their hunting ability, and desert travelers often carry a bag of these in case they need to deal with an aigamuxa.  \n  \n Clever aigamuxas know that attacking wandering prey can be very dangerous, instead using their powerful hands to dig deep into sand dunes or dirt and wait to ambush passersby. Aigamuxas are particularly good at hiding in their home environments, and unfortunate travelers often don't notice the barely visible eyes of an aigamuxa until it's too late.",

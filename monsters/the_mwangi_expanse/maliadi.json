Those who know of a maliadi's hubris can often exploit it, such as by demanding a trial by combat to force the maliadi to leave an area alone.",

The swallowed creature takes the listed amount of damage when first swallowed and at the end of each of its turns while it\u2019s swallowed. If the victim Escapes this ability\u2019s grabbed condition, it exits through the monster\u2019s mouth. This frees any other creature grabbed in the monster\u2019s mouth or jaws. A swallowed creature can attack the monster that has swallowed it, but only with unarmed attacks or with weapons of light Bulk or less. The engulfing creature is flat-footed against the attack. If the monster takes piercing or slashing damage equaling or exceeding the listed Rupture value from a single attack or spell, the engulfed creature cuts itself free. A creature that gets free by either Escaping or cutting itself free can immediately breathe and exits the swallowing monster\u2019s space.  \n  \n If the monster dies, a swallowed creature can be freed by creatures adjacent to the corpse if they spend a combined total of 3 actions cutting the monster open with a weapon or unarmed attack that deals piercing or slashing damage.",

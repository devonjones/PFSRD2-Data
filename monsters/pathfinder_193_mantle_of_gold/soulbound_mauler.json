An upgrade to the soulbound doll, this mannequin is powered by the entire soul of a sapient creature. Many a necromancer has attempted to use these constructs as a method to live forever, likely as a shortcut around the complicated and ultimately morbid path to lichdom. However, the soul within the mannequin has problems properly expressing itself and displays rudimentary control over the host, often resulting in childlike behavior anywhere from curious to sadistic.  \n Rather than embedding the soul focus gem in the construct's neck or chest, it's tethered by bands of ectoplasm within an exposed chamber on the mannequin's chest. Until the soulbound mauler is destroyed, the focus gem cannot be removed from the empty cavity in its chest. However, the gem can be displaced which causes the soulbound mauler significant anguish, not only damaging the connection between the gem and artificial body, but also impairing the construct's ability to function.",

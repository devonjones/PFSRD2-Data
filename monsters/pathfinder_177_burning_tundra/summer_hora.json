Horai erect simple astronomical calendars near their home, which they use to mark the moment when the sun reaches its highest or lowest point in the sky. An hora tied to the summer solstice grows more powerful as the sun reaches its height, while an hora tied to the winter solstice is sickly and weak. The opposite holds true for winter horai, who are weak in summer and strong in winter. Meanwhile, autumn and spring horai draw power near the autumnal and vernal equinoxes, becoming weaker around the opposite equinox. <br/>Summer horai appear constantly bathed in sunlight, with skin and clothing of red, orange, and yellow, like the sunlight of high summer."

On a failure, it is affected as if by the nymph queen\u2019s nymph\u2019s beauty aura; if it was already affected by the aura, it suffers a greater effect described in the nymph queen\u2019s entry. A nymph queen can Focus Beauty on a given creature only once per turn.<br/><b>Inspiration</b><span aria-label=\"Three Actions\" class=\"action action-3\" role=\"img\" title=\"Three Actions\"> </span>  (<a aonid=\"60\" game-obj=\"Traits\">emotion</a>, <a aonid=\"61\" game-obj=\"Traits\">enchantment</a>, <a aonid=\"106\" game-obj=\"Traits\">mental</a>, <a aonid=\"134\" game-obj=\"Traits\">primal</a>) A nymph queen can inspire a single intelligent creature by giving that creature a token of her favor, typically a lock of her hair. As long as the creature carries her token and remains in good standing with the nymph queen, the creature gains a +1 status bonus to all Crafting checks, Performance checks, and Will saves.<br/> If a nymph queen grants her Inspiration to a bard and the nymph queen is that bard\u2019s muse, the bard gains an additional benefit depending on their muse theme: for lore muse, the bard also gains a +1 status bonus to all Lore checks; for maestro muse, the status bonus to Performance checks increases to +2 for the purpose of determining the effects of compositions; for polymath muse, the bard gains a +4 status bonus to untrained skill checks; and for all other muses, the Will save bonus increases to +2 against fey.<br/><b>Nymph\u2019s Beauty</b> (<a aonid=\"206\" game-obj=\"Traits\">aura</a>, <a aonid=\"60\" game-obj=\"Traits\">emotion</a>, <a aonid=\"61\" game-obj=\"Traits\">enchantment</a>, <a aonid=\"106\" game-obj=\"Traits\">mental</a>, <a aonid=\"134\" game-obj=\"Traits\">primal</a>, <a aonid=\"163\" game-obj=\"Traits\">visual</a>) 30 feet. Creatures that start their turn in the aura must succeed at a Will save or suffer an effect described in the nymph queen\u2019s entry.<br/><b>Tied to the Land</b> A nymph queen is intrinsically tied to a specific region, such as a forest for a dryad queen. As long as the queen is healthy, the environment is exceptionally resilient, allowing the nymph queen to automatically attempt to counteract spells and rituals such as blight that would harm the environment, using her Spell DC with a counteract level equal to the highest-level druid spell she can cast. When the nymph queen becomes physically or psychologically unhealthy, however, her warded region eventually becomes twisted or unhealthy as well. In that case, restoring the nymph queen swiftly heals the entire region."

Similarly, autumn horai have resistance to <a aonid=\"118\" game-obj=\"Traits\">negative</a> energy and Strikes that deal negative damage; spring horai have no resistance and Strikes that deal positive damage (which only harms <a aonid=\"160\" game-obj=\"Traits\">undead</a> and creatures with <a aonid=\"42\" game-obj=\"MonsterAbilities\">negative healing</a>, as normal). Winter horai have the Winter Bound ability which impairs them during the summer months, and winter horai queens reverse the effects of their Tied to the Land ability (their land is healthy during the winter and withers during the summer). Similarly, autumn and spring horai are impaired during the opposing months, and their queens' Tied to the Land abilities change accordingly. Winter horai have Winter's Rescue rather than Summer's Salvation, which gives a +4 status bonus during the month of the winter solstice (Kuthona on Golarion), a +2 status bonus on the months before and after it (Neth and Abadius), a +1 bonus on most other months, and no benefit during the three summer months. Similarly, autumn and spring horai have reactions that grant a +4 status bonus during the month of their equinox, a +2 status bonus on the months just before and after, a +1 status bonus on other months, and no benefit during the opposing equinox and the months just before and after."

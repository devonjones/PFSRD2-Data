Unlike most oozes, a tar ooze isn't acidic; it is massive, however, and objects caught inside are subjected to great pressure and force as the tar ooze moves. Anything small and hard\u2014 such as coins, jewels, rings, and *aeon stones*\u2014are especially likely to remain relatively undamaged inside a tar ooze. Other metal objects, including most weapons and armor, are also likely to survive, though some might need repair.",

            "text": "When creatures carrying magical items die in a tar pit, the magic mixes with the tar itself. Over centuries, this energy animates the tar into a relentless and horrifying ooze.  \n  \n Tar oozes begin their existence in tar pits, naturally occurring lakes of thick and sticky petroleum. Tar pits make effective traps for animals and humanoids alike, as they're often covered with thin layers of dirt or grass or reflect sunlight in a way that resembles a watering hole. Once a creature steps or falls into the sticky tar of the pit, escape is all but impossible. Slowly, the caught creature\u2014and any other victims lured near by its plaintive cries\u2014sinks into the tar, suffocates, and dies.  \n  \n Magic inherent in a captive creature or carried in powerful magic items carried by the dead remains inside the tar, where it gathers, mixes, and slowly energizes it until it begins to move and seek prey. A tar ooze seeps slowly over the land, catching anything it touches in a sticky embrace and devouring it.  \n  \n Living things consumed by the ooze slowly have their flesh digested, only for the bones and fur to be replaced with blobs of sticky tar. These unnatural zombies eventually crawl away, hungry for flesh. Without a master to give them instructions, these tar zombies often follow the ooze that created them, swarming anyone bold or foolish enough to get in their way.",

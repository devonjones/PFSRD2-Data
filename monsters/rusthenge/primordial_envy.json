This hunger can be exploited by clever adventurers who bait it with powerful destructive magics. A primordial envy is one of the most defensive sin oozes, and it tends to layer abjuration spells over itself to both increase its resilience and empower its attacks.",

The slithering lust's sweet scents enthrall victims with their deepest desires, distracting them as it feeds. But the most terrible of the sinsludges are the ravenous wrath, which uses blasts of devastating energy to feed, and the rancid gluttony, which consumes souls and leaves bodies behind as lethal undead.",

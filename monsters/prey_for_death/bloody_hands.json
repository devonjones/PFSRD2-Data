            "text": "Bloody Hands was no agent of Gorum when he first rose from the polluted swamps of a remote fen in the Outer Rifts. For the first several millennia of his life, he fought for his own domain in the sprawling slime, eventually securing a realm the size of a small continent where his rule was unquestioned\u2014at least, until it was invaded by a host of Gorum's einherjar. Bloody Hands was taken aback at the aesirs' battle prowess, and he gloried in the fall of his empire to the extent that, by the end of the invasion, he was proudly fighting on their side, mercilessly destroying hordes of demons who had so recently served him out of fear. The einherjar admired his lust for battle but didn't quite know what to make of the frog-like demon, especially when he followed them back across the Maelstrom to Clashing Shore. After several centuries of brawling along the borders of that realm, growing increasingly less interested in sadism and more enthralled with the tactics of battle, Bloody Hands was granted permission by Gorum to become one of his servitors.  \n  \n Bloody Hands appears as a vaguely humanoid frog-like demon whose stance evokes that of a lumbering gorilla. His slimy green skin shifts to a bloody red along the length of his arms, so that his claws look as though they're constantly glistening with fresh blood. He has four beady eyes and a wide mouth filled with sharp teeth.",

            "text": "All deities maintain favored agents to work their will among mortals. Heralds are among the most well-known of these agents\u2014unique entities who serve as the deity's mouthpiece and messenger and are often sent in response to a mortal spellcaster requesting aid in the form of a *planar servitor* ritual. But a deity's herald isn't the only agent permitted to walk among worshippers or smite enemies of the faith. Those called servitors are unique, powerful, and stand among the deity's most devoted adherents.  \n  \n Servitors are quite powerful, yet they're not truly immortal. Any servitor of the divine may be slain in battle or through misadventure. In some cases, a slain servitor's body vanishes and is replaced by a powerful treasure. In others, the body itself simply crumples to the ground as a corpse. Servitors can be restored to life at a deity's whim, yet in many cases their deity won't immediately grant this resurrection and may simply seek to create or elevate an entirely different servitor. Should the unthinkable happen and a deity themselves perish, their existing servitors do not die but are immediately aware of the fact that their creator has ceased to be. Some myths tell of servitors who have then gone on to ascend in power and replace their creator as a demigod or even a deity themselves, while in other stories, a desperate servitor may seek out a new god or goddess to devote themselves to.  \n  \n While servitors are all unique creatures, in most cases they were once mortal worshippers\u2014be they humanoid or otherwise\u2014who have particularly pleased their deity. The resulting powers and abilities granted to the servitor vary wildly, but it's almost unheard of for a servitor of any deity to be less powerful than 15th level, or at least a few levels above what they possessed in their previous life. While there are not limits to the number of servitors a deity might keep, most gods traditionally keep no more than three.  \n  \n In Gorum's case, his three most well-known servitors are comprised of a demon, dragon, and an elemental, creatures who either embody the chaos of battle or the raw spirit of the forge. In each case, these unique servitors' worldview and philosophy closely match that of their Lord in Iron, leaving them outcasts or even pariahs among others of their kind. Yet to Bloody Hands, Saint Fang, and Temperbrand, there is no greater comfort in life than service to the god of war.",

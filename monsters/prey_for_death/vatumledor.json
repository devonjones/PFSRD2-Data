Always eager to take part in conspiracies, the complicated plan to catch the hidden traitors who plot against Jakalyn from within the ranks of the Vernai delights the dragon's sense of irony. For now, he works to maintain the current leadership of the Red Mantis rather than conspire for its change. Once he finally brings the PCs into his confidence at the end of Chapter 1, he becomes a potent ally and source of information they can call upon.  \n  \n***Recall Knowledge - Dragon* (*Arcana*)**: DC 45  \n***Unspecific Lore***: DC 43  \n***Specific Lore***: DC 40",

            "text": "When the world was young, Achaekek was the arbiter of the gods. He acted as judge and executioner for any who opposed them. When asked, he would also rein in the strength of unruly gods who threatened what the deities had created. Yet, by the time an alliance of the divine rose to oppose the god Rovagug and imprison him within the Dead Vault, Achaekek had already lost his way and retreated into hiding.  \n  \n It would be countless eons before Achaekek began interacting with the world again, at which point a family of dragons who respected peace and order heard Achaekek's whispers. They took care of the suffering deity, as much as any mortal\u2014even a dragon\u2014could care for a god, and their worship and their daily recitation of his teachings helped refocus Achaekek. Millennia passed, and the family of dragons fostered new broods, grew ancient and died, and younger dragons took their place.  \n  \n When humans, specifically the Azlanti, discovered Achaekek, they worshipped him as the god of monsters and natural disasters, inspired by his horrific shape and violent nature. The dragons stealthily infiltrated Azlanti society and tried to teach the Azlanti about Achaekek's true purpose, but they would not listen. And so, the dragon family kept his original purpose and ancient role to themselves, opting to wait for a time when these short-lived mortals were ready to understand. When Earthfall devastated Golarion, though, this family of dragons perished, and Achaekek's faith once again receded into obscurity.  \n  \n For thousands of years, Achaekek's faith remained hidden until his legacy was discovered by a powerful conspirator dragon named Szandinal. More taken with the legacy of the mysterious dragons who kept the god's faith alive, Szandinal revived the worship of Achaekek among his siblings and children. In time, a new draconic dynasty associated with the Mantis God arose. They watched with amusement as the Red Mantis assassins rose to power, and marked the way in which Achaekek and these assassins seemed to influence each other more and more with each passing century. Over the years, this family of conspirator dragons never grew particularly large, but with each new generation the dragons grew more devoted to Achaekek, reveling in the hidden lore they alone knew about the god and venerating him in the old ways as a god of arbitration rather than assassination.  \n  \n Tragedy struck in 4534 AR, when then Blood Mistress Behezamine discovered the existence of this \u201cconspiracy of heretical dragons\u201d who venerated Achaekek in secret. She gathered her best and most promising assassins and hunted down Szandinal's five surviving scions and assassinated them. Yet one dragon, Vatumledor, escaped her notice\u2014in no small part due to a conspiracy between him and one of Behezamine's most ambitious followers, a talented but unproven assassin named Jakalyn. In return for her aid in escaping from Blood Mistress Behezamine's wrath, Vatumledor became a close confidant and ally for Jakalyn. In time, this hidden alliance would not only help to increase Jakalyn's influence and power\u2014it would culminate in her overthrowing Behezamine, an act Vatumledor considered to be Achaekek's justice for what she did to his family. With his talent at weaving conspiracies and altering historical records, Vatumledor played a key role in Jakalyn's erasure of Behezamine from history itself.",

If it comes under the effect of a second polymorph effect, the second polymorph effect attempts to counteract the first. If it succeeds, it takes effect, and if it fails, the spell has no effect on that target. Any Strikes specifically granted by a polymorph effect are magical. Unless otherwise stated, polymorph spells don't allow the target to take on the appearance of a specific individual creature, but rather just a generic creature of a general type or ancestry.  \n  \n If you take on a battle form with a polymorph spell, the special statistics can be adjusted only by circumstance bonuses, status bonuses, and penalties. Unless otherwise noted, the battle form prevents you from casting spells, speaking, and using most manipulate actions that require hands. (If there's doubt about whether you can use an action, the GM decides.) Your gear is absorbed into you; the constant abilities of your gear still function, but you can't activate any items. If a polymorph effect causes you to increase in size, you must have space to expand into or the effect is disrupted.",

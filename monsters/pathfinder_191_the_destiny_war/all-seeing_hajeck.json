While she comes back as a more powerful entity\u2014a lamia matriarch\u2014 she realizes her new incarnation is as much an insult as anything else, for she has become a living embodiment of the harrow card known as *The Liar*. She first appears in the Harrowed Realm and eventually learns she cannot leave this demiplane. Her interactions with the PCs can either redeem her for her life of lies or see her embrace deception and, potentially, become a conspirator against the PCs, as detailed in the adventure itself. As long as she remains their ally, however, All-Seeing Hajeck can draw upon the power of the Harrowed Realm to bolster their destinies by performing Harrowing Visions for them.  \n  \n***Recall Knowledge - Beast* (*Arcana*, *Nature*)**: DC 40  \n***Unspecific Lore***: DC 38  \n***Specific Lore***: DC 35",

Much like the *Deck of Destiny*, the *Deck of Harrowed Tales* links to a demiplane\u2014one known as the Harrowed Realm. Soon after she inherited the *Deck of Harrowed Tales*, Hajeck fell under the influence of a powerful dragon named Zassrion who had been trapped within the Harrowed Realm for untold ages. The dragon used Hajeck as a pawn to lure victims from the real world into the Harrowed Realm, where he attempted to use their bodies as a catalyst to empower his escape. When the dragon was ultimately defeated, Hajeck escaped his magical control.  \n  \n Ashamed and humiliated by her time spent under the dragon's control, Hajeck left the Umbra Carnival and relocated, in time, to the city of Absalom, where she hoped to bury her past and start a new life, only to become embroiled with an even more powerful harrow-themed artifact: the *Deck of Destiny*. And this time, she wasn't so lucky\u2014this time, she paid with her life (see the start of the previous adventure, \u201cThe Choosing,\u201d for more details).",

If it comes under the effect of a second polymorph effect, the second polymorph effect attempts to counteract the first. If it succeeds, it takes effect, and if it fails, the spell has no effect on that target. Any Strikes specifically granted by a polymorph effect are magical. Unless otherwise stated, polymorph spells don't allow the target to take on the appearance of a specific individual creature, but rather just a generic creature of a general type or ancestry.  \n  \n If you take on a battle form with a polymorph spell, the special statistics can be adjusted only by circumstance bonuses, status bonuses, and penalties. Unless otherwise noted, the battle form prevents you from casting spells, speaking, and using most manipulate actions that require hands. (If there's doubt about whether you can use an action, the GM decides.) Your gear is absorbed into you; the constant abilities of your gear still function, but you can't activate any items.",

A Harrowing Vision takes an hour to perform, but most of that time consists of Hajeck and her chosen subject meditating and clearing their minds in a secluded area, culminating in an intense harrow reading that itself takes only a few minutes to complete. The target of a Harrowing Vision must remain adjacent to Hajeck for the entire hour, after which Hajeck shuffles her harrow deck and lays out seven cards, face down\u2014one in the center (the future), two to either side (the present), and four more at the top, bottom, left, and right surrounding the central three (the past).  \n When the harrowing takes place, the target flips over the four cards from the past, followed by the two present cards, and then finally the central card. This method of harrowing symbolizes how the choices a person made in their past often present them with an either/or decision in the now, and that their decision on that subject will lock in a future result. When All-Seeing Hajeck performs this reading for a PC, try to interpret the four cards from the past as representing events from that character's history\u2014be it their background or references to events that took place during the Stolen Fate Adventure Path. For the two cards representing the present, try to interpret them as symbols of questions, events, or mysteries the PC is currently facing.  \n Only the card representing the future has an actual game effect. When this central, final card is revealed, all of the PCs' potential futures suddenly flash in their mind in an overwhelming, chaotic vision. The PC must attempt a DC 32 Will save (note that as a PC grows more powerful and their Will save increases, they're more likely to achieve a better result from a Harrowing Vision, since they're that much closer to their ultimate destiny and are bolstered by the weight of their previous choices and decisions). If the suit of the card revealed for the PCs' future matches the PC's key ability from their class, they gain a +1 status bonus on this Will save. If the alignment of the card revealed matches the PC's alignment, they gain a +2 status bonus to this will save. If both match, these bonuses stack to a +3 status bonus, and the actual result of the save is improved by one degree of success. If neither the suit or alignment match the PC, they reduce the actual result of the save by one degree of success. Regardless of the result, that character cannot receive another Harrowing Vision until they gain a level, at which point any lingering effects from the Harrowing Vision end."

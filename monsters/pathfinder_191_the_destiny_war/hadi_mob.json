They cling to evil ways largely out of tradition or fear, but there are an increasing number of hadis who admire Kho's derhiis and seek their own paths. Others, particularly those who have traveled far from Kho, have come to understand the plight of their folk under the weight of a fiendish past. Non-evil hadi thus exist, but they are viewed by those in positions of power in Kho as dangers to the social order. These hadi do not carry the pestilence their more sinister kin do and many actively work to suppress the spread of illnesses.",

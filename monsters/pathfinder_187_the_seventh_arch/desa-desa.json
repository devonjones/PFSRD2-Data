The former head of the department, Shimah Teph, believed that the cats could keep a ship aloft indefnitely, while feeding them just a few scraps of meat, and managed to pilot a test fight to Laubu Mesa before dying of desa-desa-inficted wounds.",

A typical desa-desa is roughly the size and shape of a bobcat. Its head is reptilian, sporting large eyes and slender fangs that protrude from its lips. Desa-desa fur tends to match their environment\u2014most are dark green and brown\u2014and is punctuated by patterns of small, bubble-like bladders that protrude from the creature's skin like transparent boils. Every desa-desa has a different bladder pattern, and this distinctive anatomical feature is key to the creature's survival.  \n  \n Desa-desas' lives revolve around a little-understood (and likely magical) process by which the creatures transform water into its constituent gaseous elements. A desa-desa stores these gasses in the polyp-like bladders, which are lined with an electricity-conducting material that allows the creature to create sudden blasts of flame in all directions.  \n  \n As a predator, the desa-desa's most dangerous attack is its bite, which passes along its bubble venom, which can ravage the fluids in the victim's own body. This reaction causes water in the target's cells to split rapidly, creating bubbles of gas that percolate through the creature's flesh to its skin, where it balloons outward in large, agonizing blisters before popping. The combustible gasses in these blisters also make a creature particularly susceptible to fire attacks\u2014such as the desa-desa's defensive blast. A typical desa-desa is 4 feet long counting the tail, and weighs just 30 pounds.",

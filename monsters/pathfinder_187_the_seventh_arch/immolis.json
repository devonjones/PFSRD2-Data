Before setting out, hunters paint their bodies in a thick layer of mud to camoufage themselves from the immolises' heatsense. Using torches and carefully shaped brush fres, Wemnora hunters attempt to drive immolises out of their lairs and into boxes with a single, closable window. These boxes are then used as siege weapons: simply point a box at opposing troops, open the window, and let an angry immolis set them ablaze.",

            "text": "Most complex organisms, whether plant or animal, produce energy by converting fuel (such as food) into heat. Though this process is invaluable, it's also a vulnerability\u2014one that the immolis has evolved to exploit.  \n  \n Immolises are psychic predators found all across Castrovel, especially underground and in cool environs. Mostly blind, they hunt by sensing the body heat of other creatures. When an immolis acquires a target, it focuses its innate psychic energies in an invisible beam aimed at its prey. The sudden influx of energy causes the target's metabolism to accelerate rapidly, spurring the creature's body to produce energy at a dangerous rate. This sudden rush of heat literally cooks the creature internally\u2014 innards burst, blood boils, and fat catches fire. The end result isn't just warm food, but a meal roasted to morbid perfection.  \n  \n An immolis's basic shape resembles that of a spidery, spindly frog covered in delicate scales. The head has a simian muzzle, the lips of which pull back to reveal a squid-like beak. Above the mouth, the creature has three pairs of nostrils, which fare and chuff as the creature hunts. Though they walk with a hunch, immolises climb with shocking speed.  \n  \n Unlike many other pyro-predators, immolises have a deep and paradoxical fear of fire, perhaps because they know how easily any flesh\u2014 their own included\u2014can blacken and burn. As a result, they prefer to lair near water. This presents its own problem, however, as their heat sense is easily disrupted by creatures taking steps to hide their heat signatures, such as submerging themselves in water or snow. While intelligent enough to communicate and band together with others of their kind, immolises view all other species as either prey or threats and have as little interest in cultural exchange as in personal possessions.  \n  \n The average immolis stands 5 feet tall and weighs 150 pounds.",

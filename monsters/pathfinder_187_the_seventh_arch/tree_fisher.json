A creature grabbed by the filament at the beginning of its turn takes 5 bleed damage.  \n The tree fisher can sever the filament and release any creature grabbed by it as a free action. The filament can be severed by a Strike that deals at least 10 slashing damage to it. This doesn't deal any damage to the tree fisher itself. The filament has AC 17, and its Escape DC is 19.  \n The tree fisher has only one harpoon; if the filament is severed, the tree fisher loses this ability and its ranged attack for 1 week as it fashions a new harpoon."

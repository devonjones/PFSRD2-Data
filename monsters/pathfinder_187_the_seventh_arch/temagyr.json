Able to blend in with and step between shadows to surprise victims, temagyrs delight in ambush tactics.  \n  \n An average temagyr is 8 feet long and weighs 500 pounds but moves with unnatural fluidity and grace, the shadows they carry seeming to hang in the air behind them. In combat, a temagyr can take down opponents either with physical attacks or by taking bites out of their enemy's shadow. These shadow wounds, which remain visible unless healed, often perplex Material Plane doctors and investigators; a corpse from a temagyr attack can appear pristine, its tattered shadow the only clue to how it met its untimely fate.",

Though some of the brighter gorgas have seen through the ruse, most are content to have an outlet for their fury",

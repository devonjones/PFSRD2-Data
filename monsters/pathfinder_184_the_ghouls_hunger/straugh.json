As a GM you can create your own ghoul variants if you wish. *Pathfinder Book of the Dead* (see Undead Adjustments) provides advice on how to accomplish this on the fly with nearly any creature, though some make more sense than others. The best creatures to receive the ghoul treatment are those normally associated with being ravenous and dangerous. When you want a creature that is significantly more powerful than the base creature, it's sometimes best to be your own necromancer and design a ghoul-like undead beast from the ground up to reflect their increased threat level.",

However, letting the natural corruption run its course sometimes results in unsatisfying monsters, so some necromancers speed the process. This is the situation that led to the creation of the first straugh. A priest of Kabriri made the monstrosity to defend a claimed cemetery from another sect of ghouls who were preying upon the interred bodies. In some places, ghouls use straughs to tunnel into rival warrens or highly fortified mausoleums.",

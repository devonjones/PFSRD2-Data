Because what's left of a pyrogeist's living form has most likely melted beyond recognition, it can often be difficult to locate. Pyrogeists can sense innately when what lingers of their mortal forms has been disturbed, and often attack without provocation to quell the threat. When a pyrogeist is finally laid to rest and the appropriate sacraments have been performed, the pyrogeist fails to return to and no longer terrorizes the site of its death.",

When inside an object, an incorporeal creature can\u2019t perceive, attack, or interact with anything outside the object, and if it starts its turn in an object, it is slowed 1. Corporeal creatures can pass through an incorporeal creature, but they can\u2019t end their movement in its space.  \n  \n An incorporeal creature can\u2019t attempt Strength-based checks against physical creatures or objects\u2014only against incorporeal ones\u2014unless those objects have the _ghost touch_ property rune. Likewise, a corporeal creature can\u2019t attempt Strength-based checks against incorporeal creatures or objects.  \n  \n Incorporeal creatures usually have immunity to effects or conditions that require a physical body, like disease, poison, and precision damage. They usually have resistance against all damage (except force damage and damage from Strikes with the _ghost touch_ property rune), with double the resistance against non-magical damage.",

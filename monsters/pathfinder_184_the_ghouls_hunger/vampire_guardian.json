It also loses any traits that represented its life as a living creature, such as <a aonid=\"90\" game-obj=\"Traits\">human</a> and <a aonid=\"91\" game-obj=\"Traits\">humanoid</a>. You might also need to adjust abilities that conflict with the vampire's theme.<br/><br/><b><a aonid=\"42\" game-obj=\"MonsterAbilities\">Negative Healing</a></b><br/><br/><b>Immunities</b><a aonid=\"40\" game-obj=\"Traits\">death</a> effects, <a aonid=\"46\" game-obj=\"Traits\">disease</a>, <a aonid=\"28\" game-obj=\"Conditions\">paralyze</a>, <a aonid=\"126\" game-obj=\"Traits\">poison</a>, <a aonid=\"145\" game-obj=\"Traits\">sleep</a><br/><br/><b>Coffin Restoration</b> (<a aonid=\"48\" game-obj=\"Traits\">divine</a>, <a aonid=\"117\" game-obj=\"Traits\">necromancy</a>, <a aonid=\"118\" game-obj=\"Traits\">negative</a>) Unlike other undead, a vampire isn't destroyed at 0 HP. Instead, it falls <a aonid=\"38\" game-obj=\"Conditions\">unconscious</a>. If its body rests in its coffin for 1 hour, the vampire gains 1 HP, after which its fast healing begins to function normally.<br/><br/><b>Vampire Weaknesses</b> All vampires possess the following weaknesses.<ul> <li> <b>Compulsions</b> Vampires are creatures of strange and unknowable compulsions. A typical vampire can't voluntarily cross running water unless it is transported while it hides within its coffin, nor can it enter a private dwelling unless invited in by someone with the authority to do so. At your discretion, vampires might have different compulsions\u2014a pirate vampire might not be able to set foot on solid ground without being invited, for example. The vampire can still be forced to do these things and might be able to overcome its compulsion just as it does its revulsion (see below).</li> <li> <b>Revulsion</b> A vampire can't voluntarily come within 10 feet of brandished garlic or a brandished religious symbol of a non-evil deity. To brandish garlic or a religious symbol, a creature must Interact to do so for 1 round (similar to <a aonid=\"98\" game-obj=\"Actions\">Raising a Shield</a>). If the vampire involuntarily comes within 10 feet of an object of its revulsion, it gains the <a aonid=\"17\" game-obj=\"Conditions\">fleeing</a> condition, running from the object of its revulsion until it ends an action beyond 10 feet. After 1 round of being exposed to the subject of its revulsion, a vampire can attempt a DC 25 Will save as a single action, which has the <a aonid=\"32\" game-obj=\"Traits\">concentrate</a> trait. On a success, it overcomes its revulsions for 1d6 rounds (or 1 hour on a critical success).</li> <li> <b>Stake</b> A wooden stake driven through a vampire's heart drops the vampire to 0 HP and prevents it from healing above 0 HP, even in its coffin. Staking a vampire requires three actions and works only if the vampire is <a aonid=\"38\" game-obj=\"Conditions\">unconscious</a>. If the stake is removed, the vampire can heal above 0 HP again, and if it's in its coffin the 1-hour rest period begins once the stake is removed. If the vampire's head is severed and anointed with holy water while the stake is in place, the vampire is destroyed.</li> <li> <b>Sunlight</b> If exposed to direct sunlight, a vampire immediately becomes <a aonid=\"35\" game-obj=\"Conditions\">slowed 1</a>. The slowed value increases by 1 each time the vampire ends its turn in sunlight. If the vampire loses all its actions in this way, it is destroyed. Due to their supernatural aversion to light, vampires don't cast shadows or show a reflection in mirrors.</li> </ul><b>Climb Speed</b> Vampires gain a climb Speed equal to their land Speed. <b>Claws</b> If the creature had hands, its fingernails thicken and grow, granting it an unarmed claw Strike that deals slashing damage and has the <a aonid=\"170\" game-obj=\"Traits\">agile</a> trait. If the monster had any agile attacks, the damage dealt by its claws should be roughly the same as the damage dealt by those attacks. If it had only non-agile attacks, its claws should deal three-quarters that damage. <b>Drink Blood</b><span aria-label=\"Single Action\" class=\"action action-1\" role=\"img\" title=\"Single Action\"> </span>  (<a aonid=\"48\" game-obj=\"Traits\">divine</a>, <a aonid=\"117\" game-obj=\"Traits\">necromancy</a>); <b>Requirement</b> A <a aonid=\"20\" game-obj=\"Conditions\">grabbed</a>, <a aonid=\"28\" game-obj=\"Conditions\">paralyzed</a>, <a aonid=\"33\" game-obj=\"Conditions\">restrained</a>, <a aonid=\"38\" game-obj=\"Conditions\">unconscious</a>, or willing creature is within the vampire's reach. <b>Effect</b> The vampire sinks its fangs into that creature to drink its blood. This requires an <a aonid=\"3\" game-obj=\"Skills\">Athletics</a> check against the victim's Fortitude DC if the victim is grabbed and is automatic for any of the other conditions. The victim is <a aonid=\"10\" game-obj=\"Conditions\">drained 1</a> and the vampire regains HP equal to 10% of its maximum HP, gaining any excess HP as temporary Hit Points. Drinking Blood from a creature that's already drained doesn't restore any HP to the vampire but increases the victim's drain value by 1. A vampire can also consume blood that's been emptied into a vessel for sustenance, but it gains no HP from doing so. A victim's drained condition decreases by 1 per week. A blood transfusion, which requires a DC 20 <a aonid=\"9\" game-obj=\"Skills\">Medicine</a> check and sufficient blood or a blood donor, reduces the drain by 1 after 10 minutes. <b>Grab</b> The creature's claw attacks (or equivalent unarmed attacks) gain <a aonid=\"18\" game-obj=\"MonsterAbilities\">Grab</a>."

If the new vampire is lower level than its creator, it is under the creator's control. If a vampire controls too many spawn at once (as determined by the GM), strong-willed spawn can free themselves by succeeding at a Will saving throw against the vampire's Will DC.<br/><br/><b>Mist Escape</b><span aria-label=\"Free Action\" class=\"action action-5\" role=\"img\" title=\"Free Action\"> </span><b>Trigger</b> The vampire is reduced to 0 HP. <b>Effect</b> The vampire uses Turn to Mist.

Use the options in the <a aonid=\"4\" game-obj=\"Spells\"><i>aerial form</i></a> and <a aonid=\"10\" game-obj=\"Spells\"><i>animal form</i></a> spells as guidelines<li><ul> <b>Bat</b> The vampire changes into a bat swarm or giant bat. It gains echolocation 40 feet, a land Speed of 20 feet and a fly Speed of 30 feet, and a fangs Strike with the same attack bonus as its highest melee attack. These fangs deal the same amount of damage as the vampire's claws, but deal piercing damage rather than slashing damage.</ul></li><b>Children of the Night</b> (<a aonid=\"48\" game-obj=\"Traits\">divine</a>, <a aonid=\"61\" game-obj=\"Traits\">enchantment</a>, <a aonid=\"106\" game-obj=\"Traits\">mental</a>) The vampire's presence brings forth creatures of the night to do the master's bidding.

The vampire can give telepathic orders to these creatures as long as they are within 100 feet, but they can't communicate back.<br/><br/><b>Dominate</b><span aria-label=\"Two Actions\" class=\"action action-2\" role=\"img\" title=\"Two Actions\"> </span>  (<a aonid=\"48\" game-obj=\"Traits\">divine</a>, <a aonid=\"61\" game-obj=\"Traits\">enchantment</a>, <a aonid=\"93\" game-obj=\"Traits\">incapacitation</a>, <a aonid=\"106\" game-obj=\"Traits\">mental</a>, <a aonid=\"163\" game-obj=\"Traits\">visual</a>) The vampire can cast <a aonid=\"87\" game-obj=\"Spells\"><i>dominate</i></a> at will as a divine innate spell. Casting it requires staring into the target's eyes, giving the spell the <a aonid=\"163\" game-obj=\"Traits\">visual</a> trait. The save DC uses the DC of the vampire's level, and a creature that succeeds is temporarily immune to that vampire's Dominate for 24 hours. Fully destroying the vampire ends the domination, but merely reducing the vampire to 0 HP is insufficient to break the spell.<br/><br/><b>Drink Blood</b> As a typical vampire, but the victim is drained 2 instead of 1.<br/><br/><b>Turn to Mist</b><span aria-label=\"Single Action\" class=\"action action-1\" role=\"img\" title=\"Single Action\"> </span>  (<a aonid=\"32\" game-obj=\"Traits\">concentrate</a>, <a aonid=\"48\" game-obj=\"Traits\">divine</a>, <a aonid=\"157\" game-obj=\"Traits\">transmutation</a>) The vampire turns into a cloud of vapor, as the <a aonid=\"129\" game-obj=\"Spells\"><i>gaseous form</i></a> spell, or back to its normal form.

Unless otherwise stated, polymorph spells don't allow the target to take on the appearance of a specific individual creature, but rather just a generic creature of a general type or ancestry.  \n  \n If you take on a battle form with a polymorph spell, the special statistics can be adjusted only by circumstance bonuses, status bonuses, and penalties. Unless otherwise noted, the battle form prevents you from casting spells, speaking, and using most manipulate actions that require hands.

For example, the Church of Urgathoa magically treats the shadow ash discovered by the player characters in chapter three to create frostbombers, whose necrotic pustules deal cold damage instead of negative damage. Such rotbomber variants can easily be made to harm foes with fire, electricity, sonic vibrations, or any other damage type the GM deems appropriate."

The effects of the spell don't occur immediately but are imbued into the bloodshroud's attack instead. The bloodshroud makes a melee Strike with a weapon or claw. The spell is coupled with the bloodshroud's attack, using the attack roll result to determine the effects of both the Strike and the spell. This counts as two attacks for the purposes of determining the bloodshroud's multiple attack penalty, but the penalty is not applied until after the Spellstrike. Using Bloodshift automatically recharges the bloodshroud's Spellstrike."

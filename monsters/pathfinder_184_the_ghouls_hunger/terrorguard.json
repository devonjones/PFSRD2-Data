As such, some sinister artisans attempt to repurpose dreamscythe blades as components of new magic weapons. A character who spends two hours and succeeds at a DC 27 Crafting check can carefully extract the blade without harming it. Should a character fail, the blade crumbles into a choking dust, a swarm of harmless but disgusting insects, or dissolves into an oily fluid. Salvaged dreamscythes are treated as a scythe and do not carry along the terrorguard's nightmare essence ability.",

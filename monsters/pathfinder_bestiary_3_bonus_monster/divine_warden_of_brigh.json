The Bronze Lady might have her largest following in this metropolis. But the city's boomtown atmosphere means that security is a concern even on holy ground. Citizens and visitors to Alkenstar know about its wind-up sentries or quickly learn about them. The High Clockmother, head priestess of Brigh's holy place, keeps divine wardens in the goddess's image visible in the sanctuary and on the grounds. These automatons are as much a warning to would-be thieves or troublemakers as they are an inspiration to Brigh's worshippers. The mixing of divine and arcane in these constructs is intended to show off innovation and evoke Brigh's power over earth, fire, metal, and smoke.",

You might need to adjust or remove other abilities that conflict with the construct's new theme as a divine warden.  \n  \n **Divine Destruction** (divine, necromancy) When the divine warden is reduced to 0 HP, it erupts with divine energy in a 30-foot emanation, dealing 1d6 damage per level. This damage is either positive or negative, determined by the patron deity's divine font (chosen at the divine warden's creation if the deity offers a choice), and this ability gains the corresponding trait. Each creature in the area must attempt a Will save with the following outcomes.   \n**Critical Success** The creature takes half damage.   \n**Success** The creature takes full damage.   \n**Failure** The creature takes full damage and becomes temporarily cursed by the patron deity. The creature becomes enfeebled 1 and stupefied 1 for 1 day; this is a curse effect that uses the Will save DC as the counteract DC.   \n**Critical Failure** As failure, except the creature becomes enfeebled 2 and stupefied 2.   \n  \n**Divine Innate Spells** A divine warden whose patron deity has any alignment components gains *divine lance* as an innate cantrip. A divine warden with a neutral patron deity instead gains *daze* as an innate cantrip.   \n  \n**Divine Domain Spells** The divine warden selects two of its patron deity's domains. The divine warden can cast the basic domain spell for its chosen domains. The divine warden has a focus pool of 1 Focus Point. It can't Refocus, but its focus pool automatically refills 24 hours after it last used a Focus Point. If the divine warden is at least 10th level, it also gains the advanced domain spells for its chosen domains, and its focus pool increases to 2 Focus Points.   \n  \n**Faith Bound** (abjuration, divine) A divine warden can't attack a creature that openly wears or displays the religious symbol of the divine warden's patron deity unless that creature uses a hostile action against the divine warden first. If the divine warden is intelligent, it can also attack a creature it believes isn't faithful to its deity or who wears the religious symbol as a ruse (typically after succeeding at a Perception check to Sense Motive).   \n  \n**Faithful Weapon** A divine warden always wields its patron deity's favored weapon. If the weapon is a ranged weapon, the divine warden automatically generates new ammunition with each attack. For a divine warden of 4th level or higher, the deity's favored weapon gains the effects of a *striking* rune while the divine warden wields it; at 12th level, these effects are of a *greater striking* rune, and at 19th level, they're instead of a *major striking* rune.   \n  \n**Instrument of Faith** The divine warden is a beacon for its deity's faith. A cleric of the divine warden's patron deity can channel a *heal* spell through a divine warden they can see within 60 feet. The cleric determines any targets or area for the spell as if they were standing in the divine warden's space.",

            "text": "Created through complex rituals performed by a faith's adherents, divine wardens have been imbued with a fraction of the power that courses through a champion or cleric of a particular deity. This divine spark allows the divine warden to serve as the protector for a temple, shrine, or other holy site. Such guardians aren't intrinsically bound to a fixed location, but they rarely leave the temple or site over which they watch.  \n  \n Most divine wardens have been crafted from clay, stone, wood, or similar materials and typically have features that resemble a deity or a deity's herald. Divine wardens often have other abilities typically exhibited by constructs, such as armor plating, the ability to disguise themselves as statues, or other similar benefits.  \n  \n The faithful worshippers who craft divine wardens typically animate the constructs using a special ritual in which the followers beseech their deity to empower the guardian. The divine mandate that imbues a divine warden with power also allows the sentinel to recognize enemies of its deity and prevents the construct from attacking other members of the faith, unless these patrons choose to attack it first.  \n  \n In rare cases or particularly dire times, a deity might create a divine warden by directly animating an existing statue or idol to aid faithful followers. These divine guardians are most likely to be found outside of their original locations, assisting displaced congregations or pursuing those who might harm the faithful.",

This takes an amount of time listed in the clockwork's wind-up entry, which also lists how long the clockwork remains operational once wound; after this duration, the clockwork becomes inactive and immobile until it's wound again. Some clockworks' abilities require them to spend some of their remaining operational time. They can't spend more than they have and shut down immediately once they have 0 time remaining. If it's unclear when a clockwork was last wound, most are re-wound approximately halfway through their operating time.  \n  \n A clockwork vehicle can be placed into standby mode by its pilot as a 3-action activity; a clockwork creature must perform this activity itself.

In the dead of night, the flickering light of a yaganty\u2019s fingertips casts dramatic shadows across their face and highlights their trollish visage.  \n  \n Yaganty fables follow a common formula. A wayward pedestrian, traveling at night and usually in a forest, follows distant lights with the hope that the lights belong to a fellow wayfarer, only to come face-to-face with a gangly monster. The story ends in one of three ways: the traveler appeals to the yaganty with a gift of gold (the exact sum necessary varies wildly by the telling), the yaganty slays the traveler over some incomprehensible transgression, or, even more inexplicably, the yaganty offers the lost traveler five candles in simple charity so that the light might guide them home.",

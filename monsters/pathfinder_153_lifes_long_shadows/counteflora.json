Unlike dandelions, countefloras do not have separate flowering and seeding stages, and can release their intoxicating seedpods as long as their bracts are open.  \n  \n Countefloras exhibit a strange intellect and communicate with one another by releasing invisible pheromones into the air. Alone, a desperate counteflora may ally with another creature if it is offered water or fertile soil. Contrary to popular belief, countefloras absorb sunlight for sustenance; they do not attack other creatures to feast upon them. Rather, the reason countefloras go to such lengths to kill their opponents is to fertilize the surrounding soil and create a nutrient-rich environment for their seedpods.",

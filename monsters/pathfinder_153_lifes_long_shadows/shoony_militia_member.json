Because of this, basic combat training is typically mandatory for all shoony village members. Few individuals pursue lifelong careers in service to their settlement\u2019s militia, however. The passing down of a sword from one shoony soldier to another is a time-honored tradition, owing to the rarity of weapons in shoony society.",

In exchange, shoony crops and animals grown for food make for reliable trade offerings, though the exchange rate is such that a shoony clan might acquire only one metal tool in a poor growing season.",

They predominantly dwell in the grasslands and hilly plains of the Isle of Kortos. Shoony societies on Kortos are known for their agricultural prowess, industrious work ethic, and skill with tools to shape their environment.  \n  \n Shoonies have a rich oral history and claim that their kind flourished all around Kortos in the days when the living god Aroden walked among them. Many shoonies believe that Aroden himself personally created the shoonies after he raised the island from the bottom of the sea, and that he had a deep affinity for their people. Whether or not such tales of companionship with the god of humanity are true, shoonies have drastically declined in numbers since Aroden\u2019s death over a hundred years ago. Shoony elders point to strange environmental phenomena around their island home as one cause of their diminishment, and others attribute their decline to the rise of warmongering monsters in the area. In a world where might often makes right, it is hardly a surprise that the peaceful but timid shoonies are becoming increasingly rare.",

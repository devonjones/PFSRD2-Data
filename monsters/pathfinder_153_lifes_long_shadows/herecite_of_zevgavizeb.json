As long as the creature is cursed, any art object, symbol, or implement of religious significance in the creature\u2019s possession\u2014such as a divine spellcasting focus, holy text, fetish, or rendering of a deity\u2014becomes physically corrupted in a way that debases the deity\u2019s tenets (a depiction of Shelyn\u2019s songbird, for example, might lose its beautiful plumage to reveal a hideous skeletal form beneath). While these items continue to function normally, the cursed creature is stupefied 2 as long as it possesses an object corrupted in this fashion. The creature can cast off its corrupted objects to remove the stupefied condition, but any new religious objects it takes into its possession become similarly corrupted. The curse can be lifted by a <i>remove curse</i> spell or by an <i>atone</i> ritual. After a creature is targeted with this ability, regardless of whether it was affected, it becomes immune to herecites\u2019 Curse of Defiled Idols for 1 day."

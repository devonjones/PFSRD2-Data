Bison horns mark the shelters of community leaders, hides and wool are used to create ceremonial dress, and meat is offered to spirits before undertaking dangerous hunts. Among some followings, approaching a long-horned bison is an important coming-of-age ritual, with youths who get closest to the irascible creatures gaining more bragging rights and respect. The rare children who manage to mount a long-horned bison during these ceremonies often become community leaders, respected hunters, or legendary heroes.",

Despite their relation to more placid bovines, however, long-horned bison are ill-tempered and territorial. Their tread shakes the ground, while the thunder of their stampedes can be mistaken for an earthquake. Long-horned bison weigh upwards of 4,500 pounds and measure up to 9 feet tall and 16 feet long. Their horns, measured tip to tip, can be almost as wide as the bison are tall.",

The minchgorm can speak, cast spells, and use its senses through its simulacra, spending actions for a simulacrum on a one-for-one basis. By using a single action with the concentrate trait, the minchgorm can cause any number of simulacra to Fly, Step, Stride, or Swim up to 60 feet. A simulacrum uses the minchgorm's AC and saving throws and has 30 Hit Points. A minchgorm can have up to eight simulacra in existence at once. Simulacra dissolve immediately when more than 60 feet from the minchgorm, or if the minchgorm dies or falls unconscious. The minchgorm can dismiss any number of its simulacra as a free action."

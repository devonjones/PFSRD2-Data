Though their creation involves some amount of magic, they're primarily mechanical, packed with precision-tuned gears and springs working in concert.  \n  \n The sturdy mainspring within a clockwork must be wound to provide the energy needed to power the device. Some larger clockworks contain a series of springs for different limbs that each need to be wound. A clockwork's crafter creates a unique metal key while building the clockwork; winding the clockwork usually involves inserting the key into the machine's back and turning clockwise. Larger clockworks require greater strength to turn the key, and typically have larger keys to allow for more torque\u2014some even accommodating a team of winders rather than an individual. Programming a clockwork requires both the key and the knowledge to set the program correctly, information usually reserved for the clockwork's creator or owner.",

The amalgam can enter standby mode as a 3-action activity. Its operational time doesn't decrease in standby, but it can sense its surroundings (with a \u20132 penalty to Perception). It can't act, with one exception: When it perceives a creature, it can exit standby as a reaction (rolling initiative if appropriate). A creature can attempt a DC 31 Thievery check to Disable a Device to wind the clockwork down. For each success, the clockwork loses 1 hour of operational time. This can be done even if the clockwork is in standby mode.",

It makes up to five melee Strikes (one for each active melee attack it has available), taking a \u20134 penalty to the attack roll for each attack, but ignoring the multiple attack penalty until it has made all of its attacks. It can use each melee attack only once and it can target each creature in reach only once. If the clockwork amalgam used Whirring Doom in the previous round, it can use it again this round using only 1 action instead of 3. The amalgam's movement Speed is halved until the end of its next turn."

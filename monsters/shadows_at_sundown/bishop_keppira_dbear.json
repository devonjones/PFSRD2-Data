Only a strigoi's shadow reflects in a mirror, and this often compels them to cover or destroy mirrors in their presence rather than risk their true nature being displayed. A strigoi can't voluntarily come within 10 feet of a brandished mirror or source of bright light. To brandish a mirror or light source, a creature must Interact to do so for 1 round (similar to Raising a Shield). If the strigoi involuntarily comes within 10 feet of a brandished mirror or light source, it gains the fleeing condition, running from the brandished object until it ends an action beyond 10 feet. After 1 round of being exposed to the subject of its revulsion, a strigoi can attempt a DC 25 Will save as a single action, which has the concentrate trait. On a success, it overcomes its revulsions for 1d6 rounds (or 1 hour on a critical success). A strigoi can move normally around mirrors or bright light sources that are not brandished, although doing so causes them discomfort that can be noticed with a successful Perception check to Sense Motive.\n* **Sunlight** When exposed to direct sunlight, a strigoi immediately becomes unconscious and falls to the ground. It appears to be dead: it doesn't breathe, its body temperature matches its surroundings, and it doesn't react to pain or other stimuli. A successful Perception check against the strigoi's Reflex DC is enough to note one anomaly: the shadow cast by its \u201cdead\u201d body shifts and moves slightly, its edges twisting and active. Spells like *detect evil*, senses like lifesense, and the \u201ccorpse\u201d taking damage from positive energy still function normally, and could reveal the truth without needing a successful Perception check. Viewing the \u201ccorpse\u201d in a mirror's reflection can also reveal the truth, for only the body's shadow reflects. While in sunlight and unconscious, the strigoi loses its resistance to physical damage. If the strigoi takes enough damage that it would be reduced to 0 Hit Points, its body quickly decomposes, and the strigoi is destroyed.\n* **Water Revulsion** A strigoi cannot cross a significant source of running water (such as a creek, river, or waves on a seashore). A strigoi capable of flight can cross running water provided it approaches no closer than 10 feet to the liquid's surface. If forced into running water against its will, the strigoi becomes slowed 2 and gains the fleeing condition as long as it remains in the water. At the end of any turn in which the strigoi remains in running water, it must succeed at a DC 5 flat check or be destroyed.",

Drinking Essence from a creature that's already drained or stupefied doesn't restore any HP, but increases either the creature's drained condition value or its stupefied condition value by 1 (whichever value is lesser is increased; if both values are equal, then the strigoi chooses which condition to increase the value of).  \n A victim's drained condition decreases by 1 per week. A blood transfusion, which requires a successful DC 20 Medicine check and sufficient blood or a blood donor, reduces the drained value by 1 after 10 minutes.  \n A victim's stupefied condition decreases by 1 per day after performing daily preparations.

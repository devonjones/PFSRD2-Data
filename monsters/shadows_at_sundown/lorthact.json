But Lorthact was not satisfied in his station\u2014like so many devils\u2014 and concocted a plan to reverse roles with Eiseth, one of Hell's Queens of the Night. Lorthact hoped to gain control of the erinyes armies of Hell and a substantial portion of Dis, while Eiseth would take the role of his consort.   \n  \nEiseth uncovered the plot, and Lorthact found himself the target of her legendary fury. His allies and patrons abandoned him, unwilling to bring Eiseth's wrath upon themselves, and Lorthact fled Hell entirely. He leapt from plane to plane, unable to find refuge until at last he slipped Eiseth's pursuit by hiding as a mortal in the city of Korvosa.  \n  \n Korvosa proved a fruitful haven and hideout for Lorthact. He quickly found a mortal powerful enough to further his ambition but foolish enough to bargain with him: Volshyenek Ornelos. It wasn't long before Lorthact replaced the man, and for over a century, Lorthact led the Acadamae directly. When Volshyenek's identity drew too much attention from Eiseth's minions, he faked \u201cOrnelos's\u201d death and continued to direct the wizards' college from the shadows until today. He collected souls over the years\u2014primarily through an elaborate hoax known as the Breaching Festival\u2014hoping to eventually rebuild his name and reputation in Hell's hierarchy, but patience was never one of Lorthact's virtues.  \n  \n His attempts to quicken the process have backfired twice in recent years, both as the direct result of adventurers accidentally interfering with his plots. In the years since these risky failures, Lorthact sacrificed much of his infernal power to maintain his metaphysical secrecy from Eiseth. Now but a shadow of his former power (already much reduced from his original strength as an Infernal Duke), Lorthact is risking everything in a final attempt to regain an edge by supporting the vampire, strigoi progenitor Aliriel, planning to betray her and claim complete control over Ileosa's soul once she returns to life.",

If it comes under the effect of a second polymorph effect, the second polymorph effect attempts to counteract the first. If it succeeds, it takes effect, and if it fails, the spell has no effect on that target. Any Strikes specifically granted by a polymorph effect are magical. Unless otherwise stated, polymorph spells don't allow the target to take on the appearance of a specific individual creature, but rather just a generic creature of a general type or ancestry.  \n  \n If you take on a battle form with a polymorph spell, the special statistics can be adjusted only by circumstance bonuses, status bonuses, and penalties. Unless otherwise noted, the battle form prevents you from casting spells, speaking, and using most manipulate actions that require hands. (If there's doubt about whether you can use an action, the GM decides.) Your gear is absorbed into you; the constant abilities of your gear still function, but you can't activate any items. If a polymorph effect causes you to increase in size, you must have space to expand into or the effect is disrupted.",

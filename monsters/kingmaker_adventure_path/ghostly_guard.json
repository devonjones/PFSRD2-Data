A PC can learn about the Forgive Foe action accidentally if they seek to appeal to a creature in the House at the Edge of Time in this way on their own, or they can learn about it by closely observing how certain creatures act when they attack certain foes.  \n These foes have a Shame entry in their stat block. When such a foe attacks specific targets delineated in their Shame entry, they suffer a \u20132 status penalty on attack rolls and to all save DCs to resist their spells or attacks. Whenever such a creature takes an action that triggers this penalty, all creatures within 30 feet can attempt a Perception check against the acting creature's Deception DC. On a success, the creature attempting the check realizes the creature taking the action is suffering from guilt and shame at their own action; this reveals that a Forgive Foe action might help the acting creature recover from its plight.",

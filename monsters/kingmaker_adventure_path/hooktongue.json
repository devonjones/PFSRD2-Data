While in this form, Hooktongue's swim Speed increases to 600 feet, it automatically succeeds at Athletics checks to Swim, and it gains a +4 circumstance bonus to Stealth checks in water. Hooktongue can remain in this form for 8 hours but can't enter salt water when using this ability. Hooktongue can return to its normal form using a single action, which has the concentrate trait."

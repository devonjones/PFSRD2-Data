This image is Medium and must manifest within 10 feet of the will-o'-wisp. The will-o'-wisp can sustain the image by concentrating, and can speak through it and control minor motions (such as movement of limbs), but cannot cause it to leave the square in which it appeared. The will-o'-wisp gains a +2 circumstance bonus on Intimidation checks made to demoralize foes through this invoked image. Any damage inflicted to the will-o'-wisp or the illusion itself causes the invoked illusion to vanish immediately."

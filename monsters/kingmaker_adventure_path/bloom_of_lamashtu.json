At your option, more of these fiendish plants could well sprout from the bodies of their victims in time, or they might even already exist in some overgrown corner of the Abyss. In this case, the bloom of Lamashtu becomes Rare rather than Unique.",

Each flower has a growing seed pod at its center, surrounded by vibrant petals in a wide variety of colors. Crafted after consecutive seasons of experimentation, prayer, and ritual, the bloom of Lamashtu is the triumph of the cultist Darivan and his Cult of the Bloom. The fiendish plant aids their effort to infect the humanoid population of the Stolen Lands and replace them with monstrous predators. While the Bloom of Lamashtu is intelligent and is capable of understanding Abyssal, it has very little interest in anything other than spreading its curse.  \n  \n Cultivated to spread misery and violence, the bloom is quietly malevolent, growing its seeds as rapidly as it can. It is 12 feet tall and weighs 600 pounds.",

Yet unlike an undead creature, a fetch is its own being, not a corruption or transformation of another creature's soul. Fetches have souls themselves, yet since these souls are \u201cborrowed\u201d from energies underlying the First World, they have no capacity to gain in power once they are created. As such, fetches who live for any appreciable length of time grow increasingly frustrated with the stagnation of their personal growth, something of a curse that forces many to seek out increasingly dangerous risks. A fetch created from a still-living creature can, upon slaying its source, sometimes shed this limitation\u2014in effect, taking the original's place in reality. This drives most fetch to seek out their source, murder them in secret, and try to replace them, yet unless the original was as depraved and twisted as they, such deceptions are inevitably laid bare when a fetch's evil nature becomes apparent.",

Rumors of fetches that are reflections of entities from other planes persist, but none of these tales speak of fetches that duplicate anything other than a sapient source. A fetch can manifest spontaneously when a powerful creature undergoes a significant emotional event or dies, either while on the First World or while in an area significantly influenced by the First World, but one can also be created by significant forces like the Eldest in order to torment and vex those who have annoyed them. While a fetch manifests from a soul's \u201creflection,\u201d and as such bears a striking resemblance to that creature's appearance in life, a fetch has no true memories of its own. It keeps fragments of false remembrances from its source as if it experienced them in a half-remembered dream\u2014which ensure the fetch is enraged by and jealous of its source.  \n  \n A fetch is similar in appearance to the creature whose soul spawned it, save that it often displays fey-like features such as pointed ears, plantlike elements, or supernatural grace. A fetch who seeks to impersonate a still-living source must disguise these features, and takes care to manifest its fetch weapon as one known to be wielded by its target.  \n  \n When a fetch dies, it and its manifested items fades away into a bloom of plant life, its soul instantly recycled into the First World, leaving behind a patch of weeds and thorny flowers roughly in the shape they held in mockery while alive.",

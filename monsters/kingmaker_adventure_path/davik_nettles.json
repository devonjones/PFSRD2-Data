He can use *nightmare* to threaten the one who destroyed him, promising to drag them to a drowning death unless the Stag Lord's remains are given to the river. *Dispel magic* (DC 19 counteract check) can remove this sinister link between Davik and his destroyer, preventing Davik from using nightmare on that creature again until they return to this location.

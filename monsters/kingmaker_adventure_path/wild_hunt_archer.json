They are methodical hunters who fire their bows with uncanny accuracy. Since wild hunt archers tend to be slower on foot than most of their companions, they often rely on wild hunt horses to provide increased mobility. Rather than carrying normal arrows, they can produce arrows as needed from magical quivers\u2014these quivers do not function in this manner for anyone other than wild hunt archers.",

They accept tasks only from sources they deem worthy, and the payments they demand for their services vary significantly, though they have no interest in material wealth.

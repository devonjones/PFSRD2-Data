They are methodical hunters who fire their bows with uncanny accuracy. Since wild hunt archers tend to be slower on foot than most of their companions, they often rely on wild hunt horses to provide increased mobility. Rather than carrying normal arrows, they can produce arrows as needed from magical quivers\u2014these quivers do not function in this manner for anyone other than wild hunt archers.",

They accept tasks only from sources they deem worthy, and the payments they demand for their services vary significantly, though they have no interest in material wealth.

A wild hunt archer can manifest a replacement living bow if its previous one is lost or destroyed by performing a one-minute activity that has the concentrate trait. A living bow appears to be made of wood and constantly sprouts leaves that turn autumnal colors and drop away; it's bowstring is a glowing green line of energy. A wild hunt archer spontaneously generates arrows as needed from its quiver when using a living bow."

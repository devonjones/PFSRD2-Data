The notion of becoming a \u201cking\u201d never crossed his mind until he had a vivid, unforgettable dream of himself sitting atop a throne and basking in the fear and adoration of not only trolls, but hobgoblins, harpies, and all manner of slavering monsters\u2014creatures who might be viewed as dangerous enemies but, to Hargulka, were now his loyal minions.  \n  \n To Hargulka, the PCs' kingdom is rightfully his own. He intends to conquer them, claim their capital for himself, and dine on the flesh and bones of their citizens. Yet despite these violent goals, the troll knows better than to simply attack his enemies mindlessly. Instead, he spends his time working with his loyal trolls to seek out like-minded monsters in the wilds to recruit them to his cause. As a result, the longer Hargulka remains in power, the more dangerous and aggressive the monsters of the Stolen Lands will become!  \n  \n***Unspecific Lore***: DC 32  \n***Specific Lore***: DC 29",

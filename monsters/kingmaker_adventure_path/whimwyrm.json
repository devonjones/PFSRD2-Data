While their coloration and appearance might evoke reactions of adoration, their moods shift quickly from one extreme to the other. Many who have assumed that their adorability and relatively small size equates to safety have met swift and grisly ends on a whimwyrm's fangs or magic.  \n  \n A whimwyrm is a slender, sleek dragon, not much longer than seven feet from snout to tail, but its speed in combat is unnerving. When a whimwyrm attacks, be it with its fanged mouth or its long tail, it makes several quick, darting snaps or lashes at once. While stylistically, these attacks consist of multiple bites or lashings, they still resolve as a single Strike.",

Creatures with this trait consist primarily of air or have a connection to magical air.   \n  \nPlanes with this trait consist mostly of open spaces and air of various levels of turbulence, though they also contain rare islands of floating stone and other elements and energies. Air planes usually have breathable atmospheres, though they might include clouds of acidic or toxic gas. Earth creatures often find themselves at a disadvantage within air planes, as there\u2019s little solid ground for them to gain their bearings, which tends to at least make them uncomfortable.",

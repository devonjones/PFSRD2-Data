Each creature in the area must succeed at a DC 20 Reflex save or be blinded for 1 round or until it Interacts to wipe the chalk from its eyes. The living graffiti can't use Cone of Chalk again for 1d4 rounds.  \n**Inky Substance** The living graffiti has 60 maximum HP and its splatter Strike deals 2d6+4 damage (in addition to splatter), but it gains weakness 5 to water",

To represent other kinds of mechanical carnies, you can swap out the mechanical carny\u2019s Berserk and Berserk Slam abilities with one of the following.  \n  \n **Bounce Back** [@] **Requirement** The mechanical carny takes damage from a melee attack; **Effect** The mechanical carny wobbles violently to and fro, making two headbutt Strikes: the first against the creature (if any) on the opposite side of itself from the creature that triggered this reaction and the second against the creature that triggered this reaction.  \n  \n **Spring-Loaded Jump** [#] (move) The mechanical carny leaps up to 25 feet into the air and lands within 25 feet (or a distance equal to the height of the carny\u2019s jump, if fewer) of where it started, taking no falling damage.  \n  \n **Water Cannon** [##] (water) The mechanical carny sprays a 15-foot cone of water, dealing 2d6+4 nonlethal bludgeoning to creatures in the area (DC 18 basic Reflex save) and extinguishing any non-magical fires.",

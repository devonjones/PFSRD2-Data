As spiritual representations of whatever they inhabit, hantus follow no preordained agenda. Some hantus choose to act as guardians, defending the forest or waterway that they represent, while others simply set out into the world and experience the wonders of life in ways that their physical form\u2014be it a boulder, bamboo stand, or tapir\u2014would typically be unable to enjoy.  \n  \n Hantus are most well known in the archipelago of Minata, particularly in the southern islands of Rendah Pulu, where animists believe that hantus manifest in locations imbued with significant spiritual power. To the residents of Rendah Pulu, hantus exist as manifestations of their culture's anxieties, fears, and ills. An individual who encounters a hantu might interpret the meeting as a sign that they have dwelt for too long on their particular worries (or the opposite: they have ignored the source of their anxieties for too long).  \n  \n Interestingly, although hantus are incorporeal, they still retain tangible characteristics as varied as hantus themselves. Some give off a potent odor, such as the scent of durian or jasmine. Others leave corporeal droppings, such as literal animal waste or tufts of fur left on a tree trunk.",

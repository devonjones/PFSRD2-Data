Its hound-like appearance mimics one of humanity's trustiest hunting companions\u2014with a few choice modifications, of course. Few hunting dogs, for example, sport sturdy metal plating and an integrated crossbow bolt launcher. Over time, clockwork makers have unofficially adopted a common model for the hunter, making it fairly easy to find spare parts or compatible accessory modules.<br/><br/> The city of Alkenstar owns a few dozen clockwork hunters for the purpose of keeping sewer tunnels free of vermin. Shieldmarshals sometimes drop boxes of extra crossbow bolts just inside sewer entrances, enabling clockwork hunters to resupply as needed.<br/><br/> Other businesses that tend to purchase clockwork hunters include warehouses, butchers, and bakers\u2014essentially, anywhere rats and other vermin tend to congregate. Though quick, a clockwork hunter's body isn't very sturdy and tends to fall apart after only minor abuse. Elite clockwork hunters are fitted with specialty armored plating, giving them resistance 2 to physical damage (except <a aonid=\"374\" game-obj=\"Equipment\">adamantine</a> or <a aonid=\"378\" game-obj=\"Equipment\">orichalcum</a>)."

This takes an amount of time listed in the clockwork's wind-up entry, which also lists how long the clockwork remains operational once wound; after this duration, the clockwork becomes inactive and immobile until it's wound again. Some clockworks' abilities require them to spend some of their remaining operational time. They can't spend more than they have and shut down immediately once they have 0 time remaining. If it's unclear when a clockwork was last wound, most are re-wound approximately halfway through their operating time.  \n  \n A clockwork vehicle can be placed into standby mode by its pilot as a 3-action activity; a clockwork creature must perform this activity itself. A clockwork's operational time doesn't decrease in standby.  \n  \n A creature can attempt to Disable a Device to wind a clockwork down (with a DC listed in the wind-up entry).",

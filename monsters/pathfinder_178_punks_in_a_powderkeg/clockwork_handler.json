Clockwork soldiers are often too costly to employ en masse, so municipalities looking to cut corners devised the much-cheaper clockwork handler, a budget-friendly construct sufficient for rat catching, door watching, and basic patrol work.<br/><br/> Handlers are typically programmed to react efficiently to certain situations such as intruders or assailants. To that end, all handlers are equipped with an <i>everburning torch</i> fastened to their hooded lantern-like heads. Furthermore, most clockwork handlers used in public places have their fists covered in a padded material to ensure they don't accidentally beat suspects to death, though these modifications are removable (removing the nonlethal trait from their fist Strike). The nonlethal approach is considered the safest, as clockwork creatures don't always have the keenest judgement on who is a criminal and who is a customer. A healthy supply of rope allows the clockwork handler to quickly tie-up unruly vagabonds, that they might be brought to justice.",

Each clockwork has the wind-up ability, with the specifics listed in its stat block. <br/><br/><b>Wind-Up</b> For a clockwork to act, it must be wound with a unique key by another creature. This takes 1 minute. Once wound, it remains operational for the listed amount of time, usually 24 hours, after which time it becomes unaware of its surroundings and can't act until it's wound again. Some clockworks' abilities require them to spend some of their remaining operational time. They can't spend more than they have and shut down immediately once they have 0 time remaining. If it's unclear when a clockwork was last wound, most clockwork keepers wind all their clockworks at a set time, typically 8 a.m.<br/><br/> A clockwork that lists standby in its wind-up entry can enter standby mode as a 3-action activity. Its operational time doesn't decrease in standby, but it can sense its surroundings (with a \u20132 penalty to Perception). It can't act, with one exception: when it perceives a creature, it can exit standby as a reaction (rolling initiative if appropriate).<br/><br/> A creature can attempt to Disable a Device to wind a clockwork down (with a DC listed in the wind-up entry). For each success, the clockwork loses 1 hour of operational time. This can be done even if the clockwork is in standby mode.",

Some larger clockworks contain a series of springs for different limbs that each need to be wound. A clockwork's crafter creates a unique metal key while building the clockwork; winding the clockwork usually involves inserting the key into the machine's back and turning clockwise. Larger clockworks require greater strength to turn the key, and typically have larger keys to allow for more torque\u2014some even accommodating a team of winders rather than an individual. Programming a clockwork requires both the key and the knowledge to set the program correctly, information usually reserved for the clockwork's creator or owner.",

Creatures within 100 feet take a \u20132 circumstance penalty to Perception checks that are hearing-based. Creatures within 30 feet who fail a DC 14 Fortitude save can't hear anything but the siren, critically fail Perception checks that require hearing, and are immune to auditory effects. This effect lasts until the creature leaves the area and for 1 round afterward."

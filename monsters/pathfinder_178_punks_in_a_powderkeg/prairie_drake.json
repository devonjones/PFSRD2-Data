            "text": "These squat, mud-brown drakes resemble scaly pit bulls with blunt, toothy snouts. The desert drake is the prairie drake's closest known relative, as both share a strong affinity for earth, can burrow through soil, and hack up balls of dirt that they aim at enemies. But whereas a desert drake is sleek and nimble, flying through lightning storms and siroccos with ease, the prairie drake has all the grace of a chicken, barely able to flutter clumsily up a low hill or over a boulder. Owing to their largely vestigial wings, it's no wonder prairie drakes prefer burrowing over soaring.  \n  \n The average prairie drake has a temperament similar to that of a wicked child who delights in tormenting others. They ambush tiny animals from underground and play with their food thoroughly before eating. To assert their supremacy over other scrubland predators, prairie drakes knock down their rivals and attack them mercilessly. They often make grisly displays from the corpses of their foes to intimidate other would-be competitors.  \n  \n Prairie drakes build and live in burrow mounds just beneath the surface of their environs. They make shallow tunnels in search of large insects, rodents, and ground snakes. Prairie drakes' presence helps to turn the topsoil and encourage new plant growth, supporting other animal life and making them a keystone species for the environment. Even their breath weapon leaves behind rich \u201cdrake soil,\u201d coveted by farmers and gardeners for the potent effects it has on plants. Being seen as \u201cuseful\u201d or \u201cbeneficial\u201d annoys most prairie drakes, who believe such a reputation makes them look weak and conflicts with their \u201capex predator\u201d mystique. After they've gotten too much positive attention, a prairie drake is apt to murder a farm animal or destroy croplands only to prove that they're far from harmless.",

While they are used as components in powerful spells as well as eaten by various cultures, the most common use for drake eggs is hatching and rearing drakes to serve as mounts and guardians.  \n  \n A typical drake lays a clutch of 2d4 eggs every 5 years. Eggs hatch within 3 to 6 weeks, during which time they must be kept in conditions appropriate to their natural environment, perhaps the most difficult aspect of drake husbandry. While it is generally easy for breeders to incubate the eggs of desert or jungle drakes (which require mildly warm temperatures to hatch) or river drakes (which must be submerged in running water), the eggs of flame and frost drakes require extreme temperatures in order to hatch, which can be difficult to replicate safely.  \n  \n A drake egg has Hardness 3, 5 HP, and BT 5. The coloration of drake eggs varies only slightly from one species to the next. A creature must succeed at a DC 20 Nature check, or a relevant DC 20 Lore check, to identify the drake species of a specific egg.  \n  \n Once a drake hatches, it imprints on the first creature that it sees. A creature imprinted on in this way gains a +5 bonus to Nature checks to train or command that drake. The market price of a drake egg varies depending on the region, the type of drake, and the exact purpose the buyer has in mind, but typically depends on the level of the drake. Because drakes are evil, dangerous, and intelligent creatures, many societies do not condone the trade of drake eggs and criminalize those who engage in it.  \n  \n It takes 2 years for a drake hatchling to grow to full size. A well-trained drake can make a fearsome mount or guardian, but many careless would-be drake trainers are devoured by their charges due to cruelty, overconfidence, or general lack of skill.",

Their propensity for forming raiding parties\u2014small social groups fittingly called \u201crampages\u201d\u2014makes them all the more dangerous; a single rampage of river drakes can quickly lay waste to a waterside village, and roving rampages of desert drakes are a plague to caravan traders.  \n  \n Drakes share a number of physical characteristics that unite them as one species despite their wide variety of habitats and abilities. For example, drakes lack forearms, leaving them only their formidable jaws and thick-scaled tails with which to attack if engaged at melee range. Most drakes would rather avoid close combat, however, preferring to use their breath weapons to wreak havoc in wide swaths from comfortable distances while flying overhead. Finally, all drakes have small reservoirs of their ancestral draconic power that they can tap into to perform incredible feats of speed.",

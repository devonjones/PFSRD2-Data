These clockworks were given modules inscribed with information and procedures for carrying out a specific profession. The clockwork brewer is one such example, capable of extracting wort, stirring a fermenter, or monitoring a boiling temperature. As many other types of clockwork professional exist as there are professions; clockworks have been programmed to reshelf library books, swab ship decks, and fill holes in heavily trafficked roads.<br/><br/> Clockwork professionals made by reputable manufacturers are generally considered safe to interact with the public. Accidents have been known to occur, however, particularly when careless engineers fail to perform regular maintenance checks or when operators program a clockwork with insufficiently specific directives. Flesh and blood laborers forced to work in close proximity to a clockwork professional tend to keep a wide berth.",

This takes 1 minute. Once wound, it remains operational for the listed amount of time, usually 24 hours, after which time it becomes unaware of its surroundings and can't act until it's wound again. Some clockworks' abilities require them to spend some of their remaining operational time. They can't spend more than they have and shut down immediately once they have 0 time remaining. If it's unclear when a clockwork was last wound, most clockwork keepers wind all their clockworks at a set time, typically 8 a.m.<br/><br/> A clockwork that lists standby in its wind-up entry can enter standby mode as a 3-action activity. Its operational time doesn't decrease in standby, but it can sense its surroundings (with a \u20132 penalty to Perception). It can't act, with one exception: when it perceives a creature, it can exit standby as a reaction (rolling initiative if appropriate).<br/><br/> A creature can attempt to Disable a Device to wind a clockwork down (with a DC listed in the wind-up entry). For each success, the clockwork loses 1 hour of operational time. This can be done even if the clockwork is in standby mode.",

Some larger clockworks contain a series of springs for different limbs that each need to be wound. A clockwork's crafter creates a unique metal key while building the clockwork; winding the clockwork usually involves inserting the key into the machine's back and turning clockwise. Larger clockworks require greater strength to turn the key, and typically have larger keys to allow for more torque\u2014some even accommodating a team of winders rather than an individual. Programming a clockwork requires both the key and the knowledge to set the program correctly, information usually reserved for the clockwork's creator or owner.",

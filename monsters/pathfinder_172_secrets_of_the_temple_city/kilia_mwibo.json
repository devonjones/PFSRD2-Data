This is a precise sense against creatures who are under powerful emotion effects like rage, those who are frightened, or, at the GM's discretion, those who are in the grips of hatred, sadness, or other overwhelming negative emotions. Against all other creatures that possess emotions, this is an imprecise sense. A creature that has no emotions is effectively invisible to a kilia mwibo. A creature that knows about emotion sense can take precautions to Hide and Sneak from a kilia mwibo, in this case by suppressing feelings of negativity. You can flnd more details on hiding from special senses here.",

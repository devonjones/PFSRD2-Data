When unable to locate buried remains, ba'aupa mdoudus are drawn reluctantly to the surface in search of bones from the living; living bones can sustain a ba'aupa mdoudu, but the flavor (particularly the temperature of warm bones fresh from the flesh) unsettles them a bit.  \n  \n Ba'aupa mdoudus produce a slimy acid that liquefies minerals, allowing them to burrow though even solid stone and strip natural deposits of calcium from nearby rocks. In doing so, they leave smooth tunnels in their wake. When provoked, ba'aupa mdoudus secrete this acid through numerous pores along their length as a defensive response and accelerate this secretion under extreme circumstances.",

This impression tends to quickly fade at the sight of the creature's claws, six wicked, scythe-like blades capable of disemboweling a foe with a single well-placed slash. Despite their intimidating appearance, these enormous claws are used primarily to separate tasty leaves and branches from the tops of the tall trees upon which the therizinosaurus feeds. Nonetheless, travelers through a therizinosaurus's territory are wisely advised to give the creature a wide berth, less they wind up on the wrong end of its notoriously foul temper.",

Lizardfolk and xulgaths are fond of using dinosaurs as beasts of burden, mounts, or even war beasts. Certain dinosaurs, such as velociraptors and deinonychuses, make excellent trackers as well. The largest and most dangerous dinosaurs, such as the tyrannosaurus, are generally avoided, although more powerful creatures like giants have been known to be able to keep them as pets, guardians, or even brutal executioners. In more bloodthirsty cultures, dinosaurs are sadly sometimes used as combatants in gladiatorial battles.",

            "text": "Remnants from the world's primeval era, these enormous reptilian animals still exist in large numbers in remote wildernesses or underground in magical Darklands caverns. Lizardfolk, orcs, giants, and other humanoids who live near dinosaurs use the animals as mounts, guards, or hunting beasts. Occasionally, rich nobles will collect dinosaurs to display them in menageries, which almost inevitably leads to cast-offs being nursed back to health by druids and other champions of nature. When dinosaurs establish themselves in regions outside their normal habitats, it's often the result of a large collection being released.",

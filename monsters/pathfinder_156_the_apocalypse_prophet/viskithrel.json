Summoning multiple viskithrels at once requires more powerful magic, and is usually performed only by the most powerful xulgath priests or by Darklands denizens who live near stable gates to Gluttondark.",

They are social creatures by nature and prefer to hunt in large packs, chasing down prey and tearing them apart to share with their fellow hunters. A lone viskithrel forgoes hunting to frantically seek out others of its kind, starving to death if it cannot do so. Although viskithrels attack nearly any other creatures they encounter, they virtually never fight other viskithrels; even beasts in rival packs give each other space rather than fight over territory or prey.  \n  \n Other, smarter denizens of Gluttondark, such as xilvireks herd and train viskithrels, working to convince the viskithrels that the trainer is one of their pack. This not only protects the trainer from attacks by the viskithrels, but also enables the trainer to easily direct them.",

If a swallowed creature is of the maximum size listed, the monster can\u2019t use Swallow Whole again. If the creature is smaller than the maximum, the monster can usually swallow more creatures; the GM determines the maximum. The monster attempts an Athletics check opposed by the grabbed creature\u2019s Reflex DC. If it succeeds, it swallows the creature. The monster\u2019s mouth or jaws no longer grab a creature it has swallowed, so the monster is free to use them to Strike or Grab once again. The monster can\u2019t attack creatures it has swallowed.  \n  \n A swallowed creature is grabbed, is slowed 1, and has to hold its breath or start suffocating. The swallowed creature takes the listed amount of damage when first swallowed and at the end of each of its turns while it\u2019s swallowed. If the victim Escapes this ability\u2019s grabbed condition, it exits through the monster\u2019s mouth. This frees any other creature grabbed in the monster\u2019s mouth or jaws. A swallowed creature can attack the monster that has swallowed it, but only with unarmed attacks or with weapons of light Bulk or less. The engulfing creature is flat-footed against the attack. If the monster takes piercing or slashing damage equaling or exceeding the listed Rupture value from a single attack or spell, the engulfed creature cuts itself free. A creature that gets free by either Escaping or cutting itself free can immediately breathe and exits the swallowing monster\u2019s space.  \n  \n If the monster dies, a swallowed creature can be freed by creatures adjacent to the corpse if they spend a combined total of 3 actions cutting the monster open with a weapon or unarmed attack that deals piercing or slashing damage.",

Their staple foods are spiced mixes of fruits, vegetables, nuts, and lentils. The extrasensory abilities of kashrishi have an additional gustatory effect, creating flavor profiles uniquely delicious to kashrishi and fascinatingly eccentric to other ancestries. Those with adventurous palettes often seek out kashrishi cuisine, filling many a kashrishi chef's coffers with gold.",

Those with a deeper understanding know that there's plenty more nuance to interacting with kashrishi, who possess innate psychic abilities that greatly alter the way they communicate with the rest of the world. Unable to turn off their powers, these abilities add a complex dynamic to interpreting their surroundings. Without deeper understanding of a person, kashrishi are only able to get the most vague, general feelings from people around them. This becomes more refined as their relationships evolve; family and friends are often the easiest to engage in psychic communication, while strangers simply add to the amount of mental noise a kashrishi must process.  \n  \n Kashrishi resemble rhinoceroses, with soft, textured skin that can range from light sandy hues to darker obsidian, or rarer jewel tones of deep sapphire or ruby. The size and number of their horns vary. Kashrishi communities are generally quite welcoming to others, enjoying the conversation and unique auras of every new stranger. However, chaotic environments can overwhelm and overstimulate kashrishi not yet adept at filtering psychic energies, leaving some with limited tolerance for extensive social interaction with strangers and requiring they take periods of time to refocus after socializing. In spite of this possible drawback, kashrishi are typically strong communicators, excelling at roles that require attention to detail.",

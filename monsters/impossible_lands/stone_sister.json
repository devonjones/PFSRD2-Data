The armies of Holomog were once a dominant force in the region, repelling several invasions from powerful rivals. However, when they sought to expand into the nation of Geb, their campaign quickly ended. Shortly after crossing Geb's southern border, the entire army was struck by a terrible curse that turned every warrior into a stone statue. Now known as the Field of Maidens, the statues have stood frozen for centuries, weapons in hand.  \n  \n Yet some of these warriors possess a will even stronger than stone. When approached, there's a chance the spirits of the fallen will animate their statues and attack outsiders with the same deadly coordination they had in life.",

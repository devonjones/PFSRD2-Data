Records vividly describe the creature's haunting sounds and the cold, blue ghosts of a thousand eyes floating above its gaping maw. The unliving horror cut a swath of destruction across Nex before defenders stopped it at the nation's capital. When the defenders of Quantium drove off the besieging benthic reaver, it fled to the ocean depths off Nex's coastline to avoid destruction. Ever since, unconfirmed sightings by fishers and divers have kept its legend alive. While some see the sailors who blame the creature for unexplained shipwrecks as superstitious, mages inside Nex frequently scry the coast, afraid that a more active Geb might try to reclaim one of his greatest weapons.",

            "text": "Most commonly found in Vudra and Jalmeray, ratajin aren't so much twisted by curses as they are molded by the lingering effects of curses inflicted on generations millennia past. The difference lies in understanding the original ratajin characteristics. No curse gave ratajin four eyes on a slender face, nor triple-jointed, hypermobile legs and multiple arms. Nor did curses provide ratajin with skin tones of all hues within the color spectrum. Instead, these residual curses have given each ratajin distinctive geometric markings all across their body. Every ratajin also experiences a cursed twist on their senses, altering how they view and interact with the world around them. Some ratajin visualize the world in shifted, indescribable color spectra. For others, sounds physically manifest as feelings on their skin. Haunting melodies of past actions might whisper in the wind behind one ratajin, while another can be awake only during hours devoid of sunlight.  \n  \n While particular curse manifestations are passed along family lines, each ratajin's worldview can offer a unique perspective. Ratajin tend to be receptive to new ideas, making them well-suited to tackle complex situations. They often prefer to focus on difficult problems, working without rest until they reach a solution. What satisfies the definition of a worthy pursuit varies with individual ratajin, from tinkering with new applications of technology to uncovering secrets of centuries-old magical tomes. Their intellectual approach to problems can make ratajin especially useful in situations requiring delicate words, and their quick thinking serves them well as adventurers when the time comes for action. These same characteristics also make them capable merchants and scholars.  \n  \n Earning a ratajin's trust can prove difficult. Their large-scale communities often collaborate to devise clever solutions that ensure equitable treatment among people, but each community varies greatly due to the different needs of the inhabitants. Outsiders who require too much help too quickly might cause a ratajin to withdraw, believing their guest incapable of adjusting to life's many hurdles. Poorly chosen words of pity or meaningless sympathy toward the nature of a ratajin's unique sensory experience can also cause lingering resentment.",

This uses the weapon's reach (if different from your own) and adds the weapon's item bonus to attack rolls (if any) as an item bonus to the Athletics check. If you critically fail a check to Disarm using the weapon, you can drop the weapon to take the effects of a failure instead of a critical failure. On a critical success, you still need a free hand if you want to take the item.",

This entry indicates how many Interact actions it takes to reload such weapons. This can be 0 if drawing ammunition and firing the weapon are part of the same action. If an item takes 2 or more actions to reload, the GM determines whether they must be performed together as an activity, or you can spend some of those actions during one turn and the rest during your next turn.  \n  \nAn item with an entry of \u201c\u2014\u201d must be drawn to be thrown, which usually takes an Interact action just like drawing any other weapon. Reloading a ranged weapon and drawing a thrown weapon both require a free hand. Switching your grip to free a hand and then to place your hands in the grip necessary to wield the weapon are both included in the actions you spend to reload a weapon.",

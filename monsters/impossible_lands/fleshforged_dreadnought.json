At 30 feet tall, the dreadnought easily tops most city walls, and Nexian infantry forces would scramble up the spikes on the creature's back to penetrate defensive fortifications. Every detail of the creature's physiology was fashioned for the battlefield, from the ballista of bone and sinew integrated into its torso to the bulky ram on the crest of its head. The fleshforged's acidic blood not only serves an important hydraulic function but also deters city defenders who might attempt to strike down the creature.  \n  \n During the war between Nex and Geb, fleshforged dreadnoughts most often appeared as part of a coordinated assault and typically replaced or augmented an army's compliment of siege weaponry. Common tactics employed by Nex's generals would direct the dreadnought to crush all opposition standing in front of a city's gate and then smash through it. Should the city's defenses prove resilient, invading troops would scale the creature to get over the city walls, relying on the dreadnought's regenerative properties to ensure it wouldn't be destroyed while helping them bypass the defensive barriers.  \n  \n Fleshforged dreadnoughts all but vanished after the disappearance of the archmage Nex, but tales of their destructive power have been preserved.",

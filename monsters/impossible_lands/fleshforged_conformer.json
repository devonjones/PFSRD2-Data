Some assume the guises of humans and animals to lead quiet, settled lives in Nex, but most are discovered and summarily exterminated as defects and threats to public safety.",

Unless otherwise noted, the battle form prevents you from casting spells, speaking, and using most manipulate actions that require hands.

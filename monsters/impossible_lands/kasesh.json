            "text": "In the ancient days, before humanity dwelled on Golarion, the Vault Builders had need of something smaller in scale than the great vault seeds so they could finish their worlds as they liked. They took a small gem and wrote a word of power upon it. They gave it eyes so it could see and legs so it could walk, and made it wise. These creatures are known as kaseshi by scholars who have encountered them, though their true name\u2014the one that brought them into being\u2014is likely considerably more powerful.  \n  \n Each kasesh bears a single word of power on their emerald body, from which they draw their mind and their magic. A kasesh with the word \u201cSteel\u201d or \u201cFlame\u201d is a single-minded creature, though it encompasses all possible permutations of meaning that the word possesses. A kasesh named \u201cHome\u201d or \u201cSorrow\u201d has a far more complex psyche, and rumor claims that Elder Architect Oblosk of Nex bears the word \u201cMemory.\u201d Unsurprisingly, many scholars are highly interested in the words on the kaseshi; unlike Thassilonian rune magic, no one has managed to decode or make use of the language of the Vault Builders yet.  \n  \n The kasesh in the stat block bears the word \u201cStone,\u201d but other kaseshi will have their own magics. Some alternative examples, \u201cDarkness\u201d and \u201cIntricacy,\u201d follow below.  \n  \n **Darkness**: This kasesh built the hidden places of the Vault Builders' worlds. The kasesh is 7th level, grants *shadow blast* and *shadow walk* to any gestalt they join, and has the following innate spells.  \n **Primal Innate Spells** 4th darkness (\u00d72), *enervation*; 3rd *blindness* (\u00d72), *share lore*; 1st mindlink; Cantrips (4th) *detect magic*, *telekinetic projectile*  \n  \n **Intricacy**: This kasesh was a decorator and designer. They're 11th level, grant *hallucinatory terrain* and *illusory scene* to any gestalt they join, and have the following innate spells.  \n **Primal Innate Spells** 6th *phantasmal calamity*, *phantasmal killer* (\u00d72); 5th *cloak of colors*, *hallucination*, *share lore*; 1st *mindlink*; Cantrips (6th) *detect magic*, *telekinetic projectile*",

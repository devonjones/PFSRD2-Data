            "text": "Cobble mites look like stones or rocks with small mouths that resemble the inside of geodes. Tiny, unassuming, and typically harmless, they reside in mountains and cavernous regions, subsisting on scraps of food and gravel. When dozens of cobble mites congregate, they use their collective might to overwhelm and consume small creatures, much like a school of hungry piranhas attacking and devouring unfortunate animals.<br/><br/> Cobbleswarms, also known as stone flocks or rock hives, typically live simple existences. However, some cobble mites end up pulled from their native mountainsides or caverns. Humanoids tend to see cobble mites as endearing little creatures and sometimes take one as a pet. Because cobbleswarms have consistent, smooth shapes, they're sometimes inadvertently collected for use in road building and other construction. Other times, cobble mites simply get lost after wandering far from their home territory. Lone cobble mites have an uncanny knack for finding each other, especially when forming a cobbleswarm.<br/><br/> Most cobbleswarms living in urban environments hide among cobbled city streets. They consume the rocks caught in the grooves of boots and food dropped by pedestrians. Cobble mites are tough creatures that can endure being trodden upon uninjured. Some streets bear several cobble mites that even locals don't suspect, as the creatures stay well-fed enough to refrain from moving much or causing trouble. Loud explosions frighten cobble mites, and many cobbleswarms lash out during firework displays, mostly due to fear.<br/><br/><b><u><a aonid=\"5\" game-obj=\"Skills\" general=\"true\">Recall Knowledge - Aberration</a></u> (<u><a aonid=\"11\" game-obj=\"Skills\">Occultism</a></u>)</b>: DC 16",

Their ears are large and pointed like a bat\u0081fs, and indeed they can echolocate to locate prey much like bats can, though their eyes are also capable of seeing in low light.<br/><br/> Some believe that sabosans are distant descendants of humans who were afflicted with vampirism but managed to avoid succumbing to undeath. Others posit they were once a tribe of demon worshippers whose dark rites transformed them into their current forms. No matter their true origins, sabosans have infamous reputations among residents of towns and cities south of the equator. Even mere rumors of sabosans in an area are enough to set off city-wide hunts, and the truly superstitious aren\u0081ft above setting fires near every grotto, nook, and foxhole they come across in order to smoke out the nocturnal creatures.<br/><br/> Sabosans hunt during the twilight hours or just after dark, when their echolocation gives them a predatory edge over their sleeping prey. They are capable hunters but indiscriminating when it comes to food sources; their rapid metabolisms means sabosans must eat nearly 20 pounds of meat and fruit per day (supplemented, naturally, with copious amounts of blood).<br/><br/><b><u><a aonid=\"5\" game-obj=\"Skills\" general=\"true\">Recall Knowledge - Humanoid</a></u> (<u><a aonid=\"14\" game-obj=\"Skills\">Society</a></u>)</b>: DC 20",

When confronted by existential threats or malicious ecological devastation, charismatic leshy leaders can rally their kin into a mob. These bands often include several kinds of leshy, creating a ragtag host that can communicate with and draw power from nearly any plant in its path. The farther they travel, the greater the mob's sense of cohesion becomes, gradually awakening an empathic hive mind, coordinated shapeshifting, and communal spellcasting far beyond what any individual could accomplish.  \n  \n Leshy mobs rarely outlast whatever rallied them in the first place. After pillaging a lumber camp or liberating a greenhouse's contents, the leshies gradually shake off their mob mentality\u2014often with some shock or sheepishness at recognizing whatever crimes they just committed. Though the leshies scatter, they often retain a faint sense of camaraderie with their old comrades, making it easier for them to gather again to confront future threats.",

Dryads feel similarly, as they are bonded to a specific tree that might need guarding. More mischievous or cruel leshies, though, might find kindred spirits in sprigjacks and twigjacks, who look to drive off interlopers in the natural world.",

In the strongest areas of a vitality plane, they could take moderate or even major vitality damage instead. While this might seem safe for living creatures, vitality planes present a different danger. Living creatures regain an amount of HP each round equal to the environmental damage undead take in the same area. If this would bring the living creature above their maximum HP, any excess becomes temporary HP. Unlike normal, these temporary HP combine with each other, and they last until the creature leaves the plane.

Unless otherwise stated, polymorph spells don't allow the target to take on the appearance of a specific individual creature, but rather just a generic creature of a general type or ancestry.  \n  \n If you take on a battle form with a polymorph spell, the special statistics can be adjusted only by circumstance bonuses, status bonuses, and penalties. Unless otherwise noted, the battle form prevents you from casting spells, speaking, and using most manipulate actions that require hands. (If there's doubt about whether you can use an action, the GM decides.) Your gear is absorbed into you; the constant abilities of your gear still function, but you can't activate any items. If a polymorph effect causes you to increase in size, you must have space to expand into or the effect is disrupted.",

If it comes under the effect of a second polymorph effect, the second polymorph effect attempts to counteract the first. If it succeeds, it takes effect, and if it fails, the spell has no effect on that target. Any Strikes specifically granted by a polymorph effect are magical. Unless otherwise stated, polymorph spells don't allow the target to take on the appearance of a specific individual creature, but rather just a generic creature of a general type or ancestry.  \n  \n If you take on a battle form with a polymorph spell, the special statistics can be adjusted only by circumstance bonuses, status bonuses, and penalties. Unless otherwise noted, the battle form prevents you from casting spells, speaking, and using most manipulate actions that require hands. (If there's doubt about whether you can use an action, the GM decides.) Your gear is absorbed into you; the constant abilities of your gear still function, but you can't activate any items.",

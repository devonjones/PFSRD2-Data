Thankfully for the PCs, they aren't likely to face him in combat, though he poses a grave threat to the Verduran Forest and nearby nations. In the adventure's final scene, the PCs must convince Zibik that Ruzadoya Swiftmane has deceived him. Should they fail to counter the graveknight's deceptive narratives about Avistan and its people, Zibik is sure to make his way through the portal to the Isle of Arenway. Once he does, few could stand in his way. In his current state, he would spread destruction, death, and disease. The blight would spread. Andoran and Taldor would be the first nations impacted, but without swift and decisive action, they would fail to stop Zibik. Most living things would be killed outright, survivors would experience agonizing disease, and decades of suffering would follow.  \n  \n But in time, life would return to southern Avistan, the region forever transformed into something new. Something better. Stronger. More resilient. Zibik, his work accomplished, would be long gone\u2014unless the people of Avistan proved Ruzadoya Swiftmane was right all along. Should they mount an offensive against Zibik, rather than letting him destroy the region and bring about new life, he might decide he has no choice but to stay on Golarion a while longer. So be it. Zibik shepherds death, and life follows.  \n  \n***Recall Knowledge - Fungus* (*Nature*)**: DC 58  \n***Recall Knowledge - Plant* (*Nature*)**: DC 58  \n***Unspecific Lore***: DC 56  \n***Specific Lore***: DC 53",

            "text": "\u201cZibik shepherds death, and life follows.\u201d A common greeting among Zibik's followers, this saying encompasses many aspects of the green man's life and teachings. While typical green men concern themselves entirely with the wellbeing of plants, Zibik focuses on the persistent collapse and decomposition that allows environments to thrive. In many ways, he's the embodiment of a towering tree falling over, the loss of its expansive canopy allowing sunlight to reach a new generation of saplings. Fungus fascinates Zibik, and his long association with decay and regrowth has caused him to take on aspects of primal fungus.  \n  \n Ages ago, before the Plane of Wood was sealed off, Zibik traveled there hoping to study and understand how a plane of unfettered growth could sustain itself. While exploring the Universe, he learned that many natural areas recovered from horrifying calamities to be stronger than before, while others stagnated after experiencing even mild changes to the environment. What allowed the Plane of Wood to eternally flourish? Did death and decomposition exist here as well, perhaps to an even greater degree? Or did the environment somehow thrive without natural cycles of decay? He learned much, but his investigations were short-lived, and he never returned to the Universe with his findings; the betrayal and conflict between the Elemental Lords sequestered the Plane of Wood, trapping Zibik there. However, these same events introduced Ayrzul's Blight, giving Zibik newfound purpose. The disease caused fascinating mutations, and even as it killed off swaths of plant life, it left new life in its wake.  \n  \n As the blight spread, eradicating entire ecosystems, Zibik's fascination turned to desperate terror; natural diseases are part of life, but Ayrzul's Blight is anything but natural. For thousands of years, he's fought the blight by destroying vibrant frontiers (forming the equivalent of firebreaks), decomposing afflicted material, and absorbing disease and radiation into his own body so that blighted areas might regrow. The cycle of fighting the blight (involving Zibik's own cyclical death and rebirth) has increasingly shaped his moral perspective; he sees that drastic action against a part is sometimes the only thing that can save the whole.  \n  \n Zibik focuses his efforts on remote areas of the plane, rarely interacting with settlements except to warn them of his intentions if they happen to be near an ecosystem he plans to transform. He often spends decades in a single blighted region before moving on. The Elemental Lords of Wood know to leave Zibik alone; he's largely helping the plane thrive, even when he must make sacrifices, and confronting him poses certain risks due to the tremendous levels of disease and blight afflicting the green man at any given time. Zibik's appearance shifts as he progresses through cycles of decay and regrowth. After rejuvenating, he looks stout and healthy, his stride and posture almost regal. As he absorbs diseases from the environment, sickly fungus sprouts all over his body, weighing him down and draining his energy, both physically and spiritually. However he appears, his voice always carries the same grim determination and pride.",

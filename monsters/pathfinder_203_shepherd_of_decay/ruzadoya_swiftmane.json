After gaining trust and support from the people of Cradle of Knot, the PCs can find their way through the blighted wastes and track down their final foe. Defeating Ruzadoya not only ends the threat that she might return to Golarion and retake the Wildwood Lodge, but puts a stop to her efforts to convince Zibik to lay waste to Andoran and Taldor. Of course, Ruzadoya has had a long time to influence Zibik, and the PCs must do more than destroy the graveknight\u2014 if they want to thwart Ruzadoya completely, they must also reveal the extent of her deception. If they fail, Ruzadoya's plans to incite war in Avistan could still come to fruition, even beyond her true death and final destruction. Ruzadoya might even return to seek revenge on the PCs if they don't completely eradicate her graveknight armor.  \n  \n***Recall Knowledge - Undead* (*Religion*)**: DC 42  \n***Unspecific Lore***: DC 40  \n***Specific Lore***: DC 37",

            "text": "Ruzadoya Swiftmane wasn't always a warmonger. She remembers, as a child, that her parents frequently complained about the Verduran Forest's \u201cprotectorate\u201d status. Protected from what? By whom? For what purpose? They always believed the Verduran would be better off left to fend for itself, and Ruzadoya lived much of her early life agreeing with them, though she didn't think much of it\u2014life under the treaty was just the way things were, they said. There was nothing to do about it.  \n  \n In time, as Andoran and Taldor pushed the terms of the treaty to their limits, Ruzadoya came to resent her family's passive acceptance of the treaty. She watched too many friends suffer from ignored quotas or being outright mistreated, threatened, belittled, and harassed by invasive woodcutters and colonists. Sometimes these incidents turned violent. The Lodge's continued repeated election of Valenar the Green baffled Ruzadoya. She believed the leader of the Wildwood Lodge was just like her parents\u2014 too much talk, too little action. But, for years, Ruzadoya's family said the same thing: \u201cThis is the price we pay for peace.\u201d Over time, Ruzadoya grew worse at controlling her anger, but her parents did little to control her frequent frustrated outbursts. Ruzadoya took her anger out in battle or, when there wasn't a fight to be had, in scuffles with her friends, her cousins, even her sister Vandalya.  \n  \n As hostilities with Andoran and Taldor increased in recent years, Ruzadoya saw far too many friends and family pay the ultimate price. And if that price wasn't securing peace, why not change the terms? She attended the Greenwild Gala intending to confront Valenar and demand restitution for the losses caused by the Treaty of the Wildwood. Instead, Valenar died, as did Ruzadoya, each a casualty of the Greenwild Massacre.  \n  \n As her blood soaked the ground, thick, greenish wood grew over Ruzadoya like a suit of plate armor. Twisted branches sprouted from her shoulders and grasping roots erupted from her body to dangle from the gaps between plates.  \n  \n While her armor is impressive, it has an unnatural and unsettling appearance; the wood looks sick, like it had given up its own vitality to keep Ruzadoya alive. Even without her armor, Ruzadoya was an imposing figure. Now, she's terrifying. Her desiccated flesh, raspy voice, unblinking eyes\u2014they all make her seem like a corpse.  \n  \n Ruzadoya's armor formed from coalesced primal energy that sprouted in her body and soul when she died, fueled by her anger and purpose and in turn granting her the \u201cgift\u201d of undeath. The time Ruzadoya spent on the Isle of Arenway no doubt contributed to this surge of primal energy, though she attributes her newfound power to her own strength and conviction. Ruzadoya has come to believe that her armor represents the will of the Verduran Forest. She considers herself a force of nature with a singular purpose: to restore natural order and Verduran might by destroying her enemies. She's willing to use (and utterly deplete) any resources, powers, and allies at her disposal. No price is too great, and no creature's suffering (not even her own) is unacceptable. Andoran and Taldor have sowed the seeds of their own destruction for centuries. Ruzadoya will only rest once the reaping is done.",

The truth is even worse: a *final blade* contains only a limited amount of metaphysical space to hold souls, and once it's full, the souls coalesce into a fearsome, malevolent entity called a gray death. The more souls trapped by a *final blade*, the more powerful the gray death becomes. A gray death doesn't pose much of a threat while contained within the *final blade*, other than to give the guillotine an aura of palpable malevolence. When freed, however, the gray death becomes a nearly unstoppable menace.",

Whenever the target takes damage, the possessor takes half that amount of damage as mental damage.  \n  \nA possessor loses the benefits of any of its active spells or abilities that affect its physical body, though it gains the benefits of the target\u2019s active spells and abilities that affect their body. A possessor can use any of the target\u2019s abilities that are purely physical, and it can\u2019t use any of its own abilities except spells and purely mental abilities. The GM decides whether an ability is purely physical or purely mental. A possessor uses the target\u2019s attack modifier, AC, Fortitude save, Reflex save, Perception, and physical skills, and its own Will save, mental skills, spell attack modifier, and spell DC; benefits of invested items apply where relevant (the possessor\u2019s invested items apply when using its own values, and the target\u2019s invested items apply when using the target\u2019s values). A possessor gains no benefit from casting spells that normally affect only the caster, since it isn\u2019t in its own body. The possessor must use its own actions to make the possessed creature act.  \n  \nIf a possessor reaches 0 Hit Points through any combination of damage to its true body and mental damage from the possession, it is knocked out as normal and the possession immediately ends. If the target reaches 0 Hit Points first, the possessor can either fall unconscious with the body and continue the possession or end the effect as a free action and return to its body.

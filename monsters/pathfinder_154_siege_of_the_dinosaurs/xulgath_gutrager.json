They are stockier and faster, with necks and limbs corded with muscle. They are also denser, with multiple stomachs full of fluids even more caustic than those of the bilebearer. Like the bilebearer, gutragers lack the distinctive stench typical of most xulgaths.  \n  \n A gutrager\u2019s torso conceals its most disturbing feature\u2014a densely coiled esophagus. Pressurized bladders and a muscular throat allow the gutrager to propel its esophagus outward in an explosion of yellow flesh and acidic bile; caustic stomach acid coating the esophagus makes even brief physical contact with the organ dangerous. As a last resort, the gutrager can intentionally accelerate the corrosion in its esophagus, releasing vile acid in a burst that also ends its life.",

            "text": "Reptilian humanoids who live in the uppermost reaches of the Darklands, xulgaths (known as troglodytes to many surface-dwelling folk) often attack intruders in their territory on sight. They live in simple familial communities, battling rival groups and other aggressive Darklands inhabitants in order to survive. They occasionally raid surface settlements, usually at the behest of cruel, bloodthirsty leaders who are often themselves in the thrall of more powerful creatures like nagas or demons. A typical xulgath has dull gray, dark gray, or ashen scales, with a long tail and bony protrusions that run the length of its spine. A typical xulgath is 5 feet tall and weighs 150 pounds.  \n  \n Although today the xulgaths are brutal and scattered, they were one of the first intelligent humanoids to rise in the primeval world, once ruling over a mighty empire that stretched throughout the Darklands. Today, all that remains of this era are ruins of massive stone ziggurats and crumbling cities found within some of the larger caverns. Some groups of xulgaths continue to live among these ruins, venerating their ancestors\u2019 accomplishments, while others consider these areas taboo and leave them to become infested with Darklands vermin. Sages don\u2019t agree on why the ancient xulgath civilization fell. Some suspect it was the result of a loss of several wars waged against serpentfolk, while others suggest that the corruptive influence of demon worship rotted their culture from within.  \n  \n Certainly, many xulgath settlements continue to worship demons to this day, paying homage and offering live sacrifices to terrible creatures from the Abyss. Occasionally, a xulgath shaman can call forth and bind a lesser demon to help serve the group, but a shaman who delves too deep into occultism might summon a more powerful fiend that either tears the xulgaths to pieces or enslaves them.",

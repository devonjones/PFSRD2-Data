Gahlepods dwell in large, stagnant ponds and bogs around the brughadatches\u2019 holdings, so they are often the first to interact with creatures that carelessly wander into their domain. Adventurers who make it past these bogs often fail to realize the connection between the gahlepods and the amphibious tricksters further on in the swamp until they encounter the doblagub, who is now roused and commands their brethren in battle.",

Since they prefer to feed on humans and other similar humanoids, brughadatches often congregate near remote bayou villages and boggy riverside towns, where they can lure in unsuspecting travelers with illusory food and drink. Many a unlucky traveler has fallen victim to the predations of a brughadatch clan after wandering into a spectacular (albeit illusory) banquet, only to realize the ploy too late.",

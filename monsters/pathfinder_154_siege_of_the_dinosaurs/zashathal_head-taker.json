Zashathal retreats to alert Arskuva if the heroes prove too powerful, and when he barges in on Arskuva and Helg together, he finally figures out that his leader is an undead puppet. Helg wastes no time in overpowering Zashathal and sending him away. Even though his leader is a sham and Helg's necromantic magic has weakened him, Zashathal is unwilling to give up Sarvel's sacred mission, and so he faces the heroes at the adventure's conclusion.  \n  \n***Recall Knowledge - Humanoid* (*Society*)**: DC 44  \n***Unspecific Lore***: DC 42  \n***Specific Lore***: DC 39",

            "text": "The most devout and fervent subcommander in the xulgath forces is the fearsome zealot Zashathal Head-Taker. He has started to suspect that something is wrong with his leader, and the truth drives him into a dangerous fury.  \n  \n Rising almost a full head and shoulders above most other xulgaths, Zashathal is a proud and powerful warrior. He forgoes armor, and nearly all his skin is covered with scars from a life of violence. He has an impressive spiked crest in which he's burned Zevgavizeb's symbol, a twisted tentacle with talons. His cruel grin reveals a mouth of sharp teeth, and he wears bones taken from his fiercest foes.  \n  \n Alongside half a dozen siblings, Zashathal grew up in a calm headed by Deepmouth Kartakine, a high priest of Zevgavizeb for a whole clutch. Zashathal began making traditional xulgath art early, carving stories of Zevgavizeb into the bones left after meals.  \n  \n When Zashathal was an adolescent, his calm came under attack by a larger clutch who wanted its territory. Most of his calmkith were slain, including Kartakine. Zashathal killed over a dozen xulgaths from the attacking clutch, whose survivors spared and recruited him, naming him \u201cHead-Taker.\u201d  \n  \n As Sarvel Ever-Hunger began to gather forces for his assaults on the aeon towers, Zashathal clamored for a leadership position. He was rewarded with a role as hardscale, or subcommander, in a large clutch beneath Arskuva the Gnasher for an important mission: to destroy the *aeon orb* at the Marsh Stone Tower and guard the site until Sarvel's greater plan came to fruition. Believing Sarvel speaks the will of Zevgavizeb himself, Zashathal dedicated himself to the mission with a fervent intensity. Unlike many of the xulgaths in the clutch, Zashathal feels no discomfort around the fiends and aberrant monsters drawn from Gluttondark to aid their assault, and he is even on good terms with the terrifying, bat-like qurashith.  \n  \n From the beginning, the course of the mission confounded Zashathal. The orb atop the tower was long gone when the xulgaths arrived, and Zashathal is among those xulgaths who mistakenly believe the tower's defenders took it inside to better defend it. Zashathal was surprised when Arskuva ordered the troops to cease preparations to attack on the tower and instead begin assaulting a nearby human town. Zashathal was at least grateful for the chance at action, but he couldn't quite shake his confusion.  \n  \n Over the last several days, Zashathal has noticed more odd things about Arskuva. Where she previously conferred with him and the other hardscales, she now makes proclamations unilaterally. She was previously social, but now spends most of her time either alone or attended to by a single gug slave. She doesn't bother undercutting and bullying her hardscales either, something all xulgaths leaders must do to preserve their commanding positions. Even her smell is off. Her once-powerful stench has faded, becoming barely noticeable. For a time, Zashathal suggested that priests attend to Arskuva, but she turned them down and insisted on her solitude.  \n  \n Zashathal is strong and canny on a battlefield, but he is cautious and not very intuitive when out of his depth. Without understanding why Arskuva is acting oddly, he has been hesitant to challenge her leadership.",

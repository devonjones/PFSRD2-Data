A young graveshell usually scavenges its first lure from among the animals slain by swifter and more ferocious members of its kind. The graveshell carefully positions its chosen corpse atop its shell to cover the spikes that keep it in place. Then, the creature sinks down into a pool of water, leaving only the corpse visible above the surface. When an ignorant passerby wades into the water to inspect the seemingly floating cadaver, the graveshell fully extends its spikes to impale its latest victim before using tooth and claw to rend its fresh catch.",

Its stubby arms and legs are impractical for both walking and swimming, though the algae-caked claws tipping each limb are deadly weapons.<br/><br/> Graveshells are intelligent\u2014a fact that surprises many who encounter them\u2014and surrender rather than fight to the death.

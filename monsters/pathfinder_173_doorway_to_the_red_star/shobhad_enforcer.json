Shobhad enforcers are more rare and far more dangerous. In the wilds of Akiton, shobhad enforcers protect wealthy caravans using combat techniques honed and proven over multiple generations to devastate any creature that might mistake the caravan as an attractive target for a raid. \u201cEnforcer\u201d is a loose translation of a word in the Shobhad language that is only granted to a warrior who has proven themselves in combat against one of the deadly threats of the Akitonian desert, such as gluttonworms or ikeshti riveners. Every enforcer is a battle-tested veteran with the scars to prove their prowess.",

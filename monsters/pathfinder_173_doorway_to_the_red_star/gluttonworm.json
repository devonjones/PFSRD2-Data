While not suitable for crafting items, the shimmering greenish ore that contains thasteron can be refined into a volatile liquid fuel\u2014either through technological methods or, more efficiently, through the use of khefak, arthropods who feed on the ore and secrete refined thasteron. Thasteron can be used to fuel a wide range of devices, ranging from weapons to appliances to vehicles. The fuel is slightly radioactive\u2014not enough to cause immediate harm, but prolonged exposure can cause long-term health concerns for most living creatures.  \n  \n A significant part of Akiton's economy is based on the mining, refining, and trade of thasteron, but off-planet the liquid is relatively worthless without proper technology to take advantage of it. Prices for raw thasteron aren't included in this adventure as a result. A character foolish enough to ingest thasteron must make a DC 30 Fortitude save or become sickened 3 (and also drained 1 on a critical failure). Thasteron can be used to create alchemical bombs as well\u2014these bombs are identical to alchemist's fire."

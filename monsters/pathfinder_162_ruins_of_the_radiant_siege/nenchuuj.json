A nenchuuj's eyes are like divination pools, showing visions of all the ways various spells can fail, backfire, or warp. The smell of burnt flesh and ozone hangs heavy around them. When they speak, corrupted magical energy pours from their mouths. Regions recovering from tremendous magical fallout, or where many novices in magical studies gather, may draw large numbers of nenchuujes. They like to lure spellcasters close by affecting a fear of magic, often feigning piteous distress or recoiling from simple spells, only to turn more powerful effects against a spellcaster's allies and relish the horror this produces. Nenchuujes denounce the spellcasters for being at fault in harming these allies, stoking feelings of regret.",

These fiends have drastically changed from their dedicated psychopomp predecessors. They are creatures of spite and torment, fear and disgust. They exploit the most common and rare fears for their own perverse satisfaction, and they want nothing more than to frighten mortals and make them question their reason for existence.   \n  \nMost sahkils lurk on the Ethereal Plane, but they frequently invade the Material Plane to torment mortals and spread terror. They use their innate ability to slip between the veils of the Ethereal and Material effortlessly, often stalking their targets for days or weeks before enacting their devious plots.",

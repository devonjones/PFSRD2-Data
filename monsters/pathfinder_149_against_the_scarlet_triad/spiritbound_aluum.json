These spiritbound aluums are rarely used as peacekeepers, instead serving as assassins, elite bodyguards, or riot control during times of martial law.  \n  \n A spiritbound aluum has a dull blue crystalline focus that stores constituent souls, surrounded by a host of smaller gems used for trapping souls the Pactmasters wish to deny from entering the Great Beyond. Spiritbound aluums rarely use this soul-binding ability except when instructed by their masters. However, the murderous or embittered souls within the aluum sometimes exert control and willfully consume a departing soul either out of malice or to incorporate it into the construct\u2019s core. If not relieved of its trapped souls in a timely manner, a spiritbound aluum can develop enough will to overcome its masters\u2019 orders and even awaken to full sentience. These rogue aluums typically lose the mindless trait, are evil, have an Intelligence modifier of \u20132 or higher, and gain several skills with bonuses ranging from +25 to +32.",

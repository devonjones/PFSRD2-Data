These creatures look vaguely like the minute insects they once were, with a sclerotized head and chitinous body plates, six legs, and numerous dorsal spines lining the joints and edges of each segment. However, by feeding on the unholy remains of Xotani, the spawn have manifested many of the traits of the infamous Firebleeder, most notably a blisteringly hot internal temperature and powerful fire attacks\u2014to say nothing of their monstrous size.  \n  \n Internal heat radiates from every surface of a Xotanispawn, even from its mouth. Any contact with a Xotanispawn results in burns and the risk of catching on fire. Thankfully, Xotanispawn have also inherited Xotani\u2019s weaknesses to cold and sunlight. They are rarely encountered on the surface during the day, opting to emerge from their subterranean lairs only at night.",

Because most serve as solitary guardians, few calikang societies exist.  \n  \n Calikangs' unique physiologies enable them to absorb and manipulate electrical magic as well as other energies. They can live for 200 years\u2014though they can further extend their lives via suspended animation. For this reason, many are chosen to guard tombs or other sealed sites where living guardians would perish and constructs would deteriorate.",

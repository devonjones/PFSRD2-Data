A famous legend speaks of an ittan-momen born from a scarf that was inseparable from the great granddaughter of the woman who wove it. When she departed home to become a soldier, it's said the ittan-momen protected her for many years, even holding her wounds closed in the midst of battle. This legend serves as the reason why a red scarf is seen as a symbol of luck, especially as a gift for those going into battle.",

Tsukumogami range from harmless to malicious, each individual personality a result of how the object was treated before its awakening. Well-cared-for objects tend to birth helpful, friendly tsukumogami, while mistreated or abandoned objects twist into malevolent and violent beings. Most tsukumogami are, by nature, mischievous, and oftentimes want nothing more than to occupy the attention of living creatures.  \n  \n Tsukumogami can commonly be found in areas with a strong cultural belief in the value of caring for objects, which helps items survive long enough to become tsukumogami. Towns and villages with large tsukumogami populations are referred to as \u201csleepless towns\u201d due to the nightly tsukumogami celebrations, which can become so raucous that they prevent the living residents from sleeping peacefully.",

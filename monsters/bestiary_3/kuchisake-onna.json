These horrors are infamous for trapping hapless mortals and asking them, \u201cAm I pretty?\u201d A \u201cno\u201d response leads to a gruesome death wrought by the silver scissors the kuchisake-onna carries. A \u201cyes\u201d prompts them to remove their mask, revealing the scars and cuts running from ear to ear, giving the impression of a terrible, ever-present grin. They then open their mouth to reveal sharp, needle-like teeth and ask another question: \u201cEven now?\u201d A \u201cno\u201d leads to the same gory death, while a \u201cyes\u201d prompts them to use their silver scissors and make the same cuts on the target's face while repeating: \u201cThen I will make you like me.\u201d  \n  \n There are a handful of methods to weasel out of this otherwise no-win scenario. Answering noncommittally, saying the kuchisake-onna looks \u201cokay,\u201d or throwing several small, countable objects like rice or candy often provides enough time to run while the monster is distracted. Few are foolish enough to attack the kuchisake-onna, and those that live to tell the tale speak of a flashing flurry of scissor blades that match even a swordmaster's prowess.",

It also loses any traits that represented its life as a living creature, such as <a aonid=\"90\" game-obj=\"Traits\">human</a> and <a aonid=\"91\" game-obj=\"Traits\">humanoid</a>. You might also need to adjust abilities that conflict with the nosferatu's theme.<br/><br/> All nosferatus gain the following abilities.<br/><br/><b><a aonid=\"12\" game-obj=\"MonsterAbilities\">Darkvision</a></b><br/><br/><b><a aonid=\"42\" game-obj=\"MonsterAbilities\">Negative Healing</a></b><br/><br/><b>Immunities</b><a aonid=\"40\" game-obj=\"Traits\">death</a> effects, <a aonid=\"46\" game-obj=\"Traits\">disease</a>, <a aonid=\"28\" game-obj=\"Conditions\">paralyzed</a>, <a aonid=\"126\" game-obj=\"Traits\">poison</a>, <a aonid=\"145\" game-obj=\"Traits\">sleep</a><br/><br/><b>Nosferatu Vulnerabilities</b><ul> <li> <b>Revulsion</b> A nosferatu can't voluntarily come within 10 feet of brandished garlic or a brandished religious symbol of a non-evil deity. To brandish garlic or a religious symbol, a creature must Interact to do so for 1 round (similar to <a aonid=\"98\" game-obj=\"Actions\">Raise a Shield</a>). If the nosferatu involuntarily comes within 10 feet of an object of their revulsion, they gain the <a aonid=\"17\" game-obj=\"Conditions\">fleeing</a> condition, running from the object of their revulsion until they end an action beyond 10 feet. After 1 round of being exposed to the subject of their revulsion, a nosferatu can attempt a DC 25 Will save as a single action, which has the <a aonid=\"32\" game-obj=\"Traits\">concentrate</a> trait. On a success, they overcome their revulsions for 1d6 rounds (or 1 hour on a critical success).</li> <li> <b>Stake</b> A magical wooden stake (such as one affected by a <a aonid=\"281\" game-obj=\"Equipment\"><i>weapon potency</i> rune</a>, <a aonid=\"182\" game-obj=\"Spells\"><i>magic weapon</i></a>, or similar magic) driven through the nosferatu's heart drops the nosferatu to 0 HP and prevents them from healing above 0 HP, even in their coffin. Staking a nosferatu requires 3 actions and works only if the nosferatu is <a aonid=\"38\" game-obj=\"Conditions\">unconscious</a>. If the stake is removed, the nosferatu can heal above 0 HP again, and if they're in their coffin, the 1-hour rest period begins once the stake is removed. If the nosferatu's head is severed and anointed with holy water while the stake is in place, the nosferatu is destroyed.</li> <li> <b>Sunlight</b> If exposed to direct sunlight, a nosferatu immediately becomes <a aonid=\"35\" game-obj=\"Conditions\">slowed 1</a>. The slowed value increases by 1 each time the nosferatu ends their turn in sunlight, and the condition ends when they're no longer in sunlight.

Instead, they disperse into an immense number of individual rats heading in every direction in an attempt to return to their coffin. If even a single rat reaches the coffin, the nosferatu can recover. A nosferatu regains their strength through resting in earth taken from the grave of a creature who died of plague. If their body rests in their earth-filled coffin for 1 hour, the nosferatu gains 1 HP, after which their fast healing begins to function normally. If the coffin doesn't contain this plagued grave dirt, they instead need to rest in their coffin for 1 day before they gain 1 HP and regain their fast healing. <br/><br/><b><a aonid=\"8\" game-obj=\"MonsterAbilities\">Change Shape</a></b><span aria-label=\"Single Action\" class=\"action action-1\" role=\"img\" title=\"Single Action\"> </span>  (<a aonid=\"32\" game-obj=\"Traits\">concentrate</a>, <a aonid=\"48\" game-obj=\"Traits\">divine</a>, <a aonid=\"127\" game-obj=\"Traits\">polymorph</a>, <a aonid=\"157\" game-obj=\"Traits\">transmutation</a>) The nosferatu transforms into a <a aonid=\"239\" game-obj=\"Traits\">swarm</a> of pale-gray rats. They gain a land Speed of 30 feet and a climb Speed of 10 feet, and they become Large. Each enemy in the swarm's space takes 2d10 piercing damage and must attempt a basic Reflex save with a <a aonid=\"1020\" game-obj=\"Rules\">high DC for the creature's level</a>.

Casting it requires staring into the target's eyes, giving the spell the <a aonid=\"163\" game-obj=\"Traits\">visual</a> trait. The save DC uses a high DC for the nosferatu's level, and a creature that succeeds is temporarily immune to that nosferatu's Dominate for 24 hours. Fully destroying the nosferatu ends the domination, but merely reducing the nosferatu to 0 HP is insufficient to break the spell. <br/><br/><b>Drink Blood</b><span aria-label=\"Single Action\" class=\"action action-1\" role=\"img\" title=\"Single Action\"> </span>  (<a aonid=\"48\" game-obj=\"Traits\">divine</a>, <a aonid=\"117\" game-obj=\"Traits\">necromancy</a>) <b>Requirements</b> The nosferatu's last action was a successful fangs Strike; <b>Effect</b> The nosferatu sinks their fangs into the targeted creature to drink its blood. This requires an <a aonid=\"3\" game-obj=\"Skills\">Athletics</a> check against the creature's Fortitude DC. On a success, the creature becomes <a aonid=\"10\" game-obj=\"Conditions\">drained 1</a>, and the nosferatu regains HP equal to 10% of their maximum HP, gaining any excess HP as temporary Hit Points. Drinking Blood from a creature that's already drained doesn't restore any HP to the nosferatu, but increases the creature's drained condition value by 1. A nosferatu can also consume blood that's been emptied into a vessel for sustenance, but they gain no HP from doing so.<br/> The target creature's drained condition value decreases by 1 per week. A blood transfusion, which requires a successful DC 20 <a aonid=\"9\" game-obj=\"Skills\">Medicine</a> check and sufficient blood or a blood donor, reduces the drained value by 1 after 10 minutes."

If it succeeds, it takes effect, and if it fails, the spell has no effect on that target. Any Strikes specifically granted by a polymorph effect are magical. Unless otherwise stated, polymorph spells don't allow the target to take on the appearance of a specific individual creature, but rather just a generic creature of a general type or ancestry.  \n  \n If you take on a battle form with a polymorph spell, the special statistics can be adjusted only by circumstance bonuses, status bonuses, and penalties. Unless otherwise noted, the battle form prevents you from casting spells, speaking, and using most manipulate actions that require hands. (If there's doubt about whether you can use an action, the GM decides.) Your gear is absorbed into you; the constant abilities of your gear still function, but you can't activate any items.",

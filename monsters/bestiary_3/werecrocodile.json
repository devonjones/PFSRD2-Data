If it had any agile attacks, the damage dealt by its claws should be roughly the same as the damage dealt by those attacks. If it had only non-agile attacks, its claws should deal three-quarters that damage.<br/><b>Jaws</b> The creature gains a jaws Strike (an unarmed attack that deals piercing damage) that inflicts its curse of the werecreature.

If it had only agile attacks, its jaws should deal one-third more damage.<br/><b>Change Shape</b><span aria-label=\"Single Action\" class=\"action action-1\" role=\"img\" title=\"Single Action\"> </span>  (concentrate, polymorph, primal, transmutation) The werecreature changes into its humanoid, hybrid, or animal shape. Each shape has a specific, persistent appearance. A true werecreature's natural form is its hybrid shape. In humanoid shape, the werecreature uses its original humanoid size, loses its jaws and claws Strikes, and gains a melee fist Strike that deals bludgeoning damage equal to the slashing damage dealt by its claw. In animal shape, its Speed and size change to that of the animal, it gains any special Strike effects of the animal that it didn't already have (such as Grab), and it loses its weapon Strikes.<br/><b>Curse of the Werecreature</b> (curse, necromancy, primal) This curse affects only humanoids. Saving Throw Fortitude DC is the standard DC for the werecreature's new level \u2013 1. On each full moon, the cursed creature must succeed at another Fortitude save or turn into the same kind of werecreature until dawn. The creature is under the GM's control and goes on a rampage for half the night before falling unconscious until dawn.<br/><b>Moon Frenzy</b> (polymorph, primal, transmutation) When a full moon appears in the night sky, the werecreature must enter hybrid form, can't Change Shape thereafter, becomes one size larger, increases its reach by 5 feet, and increases the damage of its jaws Strike (or a similar Strike) by 2. When the moon sets or the sun rises, the werecreature returns to humanoid form and is fatigued for 2d4 hours."

When you need to create a werecreature for your game, you can do so in one of two ways. You can simply build the werecreature from the ground up, using the standard rules for monster creation (this is how the werebear, wererat, and werewolf presented on these pages were built). Or you can use the guidelines presented under \u201cCreating Werecreatures\u201d to turn an existing creature (or even a player character!) into a werecreature. In either case, specific werecreature abilities like Change Shape, curse of the werecreature, and moon frenzy work the same."

If it succeeds, it takes effect, and if it fails, the spell has no effect on that target. Any Strikes specifically granted by a polymorph effect are magical. Unless otherwise stated, polymorph spells don't allow the target to take on the appearance of a specific individual creature, but rather just a generic creature of a general type or ancestry.  \n  \n If you take on a battle form with a polymorph spell, the special statistics can be adjusted only by circumstance bonuses, status bonuses, and penalties. Unless otherwise noted, the battle form prevents you from casting spells, speaking, and using most manipulate actions that require hands. (If there's doubt about whether you can use an action, the GM decides.) Your gear is absorbed into you; the constant abilities of your gear still function, but you can't activate any items.",

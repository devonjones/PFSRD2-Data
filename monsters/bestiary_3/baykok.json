Its soul is trapped within until the skull is destroyed, the creature is restored to life, or the bones are reassembled to recreate the baykok. If trapped long enough, the soul can call out to sensitive individuals to beg for help.",

Jealous rage drives it to hunt isolated humanoids, especially warriors and hunters who remind it of the life it once had and squandered.

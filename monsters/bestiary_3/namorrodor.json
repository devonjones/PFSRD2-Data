Their names vary, but reports of shooting stars heralding their arrival and their eerie whistling auras are remarkably consistent.",

Though they dwell on the Shadow Plane, the shadowy substances of that plane offer them only the barest sustenance, and they forever seek to cross over onto the Material Plane\u2014 yet they can make this journey only on the eve of a death, and only in a place where their plane overlaps the Material. When they manage to make the leap between planes, a shooting star marks their passage.  \n  \n Attracted by the smell of cooking meat but particularly vulnerable to flame, a namorrodor's most common meal is a traveler who has strayed from their campfire. Unattended babies are a treat so delectable, however, that a namorrodor will risk an encounter with dreaded fire if it spies an opportunity to snatch one. A namorrodor's skin is torn and loose over jutting bones, through which the wind whistles with a distinctive, eerie tone. Able to change between a quadrupedal and bipedal stance, the namorrodor is an admirable hunter.",

In the Forest of Spirits in Minkai, for example, so many trees are possessed by kodama that a traveler might pass by hundreds, if not thousands, of these beings while journeying through a single acre of woodland.  \n  \n Kodama try their utmost to protect their sacred trees, but a single kodama is a minor obstacle to most oni or others who have no qualms about desecrating forests or harvesting them for natural resources. Like trees in a forest, kodama are most powerful in great numbers and among other kami, whom they can bolster with their magical straw ropes while distracting strong enemies with their mesmerizing presence.  \n  \n On the other hand, kodama bear no ill will toward those who respect their wards, even allowing druids and other deferential creatures to dwell within their bounds. They might even subtly guide lost travelers out of the forest or back to safety.",

The rope can be wrapped around other kami creatures to protect them from fell forces. A kami who wears a *spiritual rope* gains resistance 5 to evil damage (though this is usually relevant only if the kami is good-aligned), a +1 status bonus to AC against evil creatures, and a +1 status bonus to saving throws against effects from evil creatures.  \n A kodama always wears a *spiritual rope*, and they can have one other *spiritual rope* in existence at a time. Creating a new rope beyond these two releases the magic of one other rope of the kodama's choosing. A *spiritual rope* around a creature other than a kodama loses its magic after 24 hours or if it's taken outside of the kodama's forest."

            "text": "Most towns and cities on Golarion have a garrison of professional guards whose duties include patrolling the streets, assisting citizenry in need, and acting as a quick military response in times of crisis. Guards usually operate in pairs or small groups, but when a serious emergency threatens, guards muster at the nearest keep, watch station, or other rallying point and then move out in search of their quarry. Alternatively, guard troops might be stationed at important locations in the city, such as the front gates, the main prison, or the entrance to the ruler's castle.  \n  \n Individual guards may not be particularly well trained or experienced, but in large numbers they can defeat bandits, wild creatures that have slipped past the city gates, or the occasional drunken ogre. A group of city guards is usually accompanied and commanded by a single captain, who does most of the talking and gives individual guards their orders. The members of this city guard squadron have trained together to perform simple tactics but not advanced maneuvers.",

                        "text": "Troops are composed of many individuals, and over the course of enough attacks and downed comrades, troops shrink in size. Most troops start with 16 squares (4 by 4), and their Hit Points have two listed thresholds, typically the first is at 2/3 their maximum Hit Points and the second is at 1/3 their maximum Hit Points. Once the troop drops below the first threshold, it loses 4 squares, leaving 12 squares remaining, and the first threshold becomes the troop's new maximum Hit Points. Once the troop falls below the second threshold, it loses another 4 squares, leaving 8 squares remaining, and the second threshold becomes the troop's new maximum Hit Points. In order to restore its size and maximum Hit Points, a troop needs to spend downtime to use long-term treatment on casualties or recruit new members to replace the fallen. At 0 Hit Points, the troop is reduced down to 4 squares, which is too few to sustain the troop, so it disperses entirely, with the few remaining members surrendering, fleeing, or easily dispatched, depending on their nature.  \n  \n A damaging single-target effect, such as a Strike, can't force a troop to pass through more than one threshold at once. For instance, if a troop had 60 Hit Points, with thresholds at 40 and 20, a Strike for 50 damage would leave the troop at 21 Hit Points, just above the second threshold. A damaging area effect or multi-target effect can cross multiple thresholds at once and could potentially destroy the entire troop in one shot.  \n  \n Non-damaging effects with an area or that target all creatures in a certain proximity affect a troop normally if they affect the entire area occupied by the troop. If an effect has a smaller area or numbers of targets, it typically has no effect on the troop. However, if the effect can target at least four creatures or cover at least four squares in the troop, and if it would prevent its targets from acting, cause them to flee, or otherwise make them unable to function as part of the troop for a round or more, the troop loses a number of Hit Points equal to the amount required to bring it to the next threshold, removing 4 squares. If an effect would both deal damage and automatically cross a threshold due to incapacitating some of the creatures in the troop, apply the damage first. If the damage wasn't enough to cross a threshold on its own, then reduce the Hit Points to cross the threshold for the incapacitating effect.",

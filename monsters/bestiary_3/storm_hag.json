These crones hate those who huddle together with loved ones in warm, dry shelters while the wind howls and rain lashes the land and sea. Storm hags use their powers to wreak havoc on communities near the coastal caves or hovels where they often live.  \n  \n These hags send their voices on the wind to terrorize mortals before descending upon them with claws and fell magic. More than any others of their kind, they prey on the young, devouring children as much for the pain it causes their parents and caretakers as for the hags' love of young flesh.  \n  \n A storm hag's territory sometimes overlaps with that of sea hags and winter hags. While this may result in the formation of a coven that controls their combined territories, more often it leads to rivalries. Such feuds only increase the misery of innocent people caught between the rival hags' feuding.",

Some say hags arose from fey that became twisted by their inner selfishness. Hags gather together in covens for greater power, craft unique magical items known as *hag eyes*, and are known to replace infant humanoids with their own offspring\u2014these children are changelings who have the potential to become hags themselves.  \n  \nFoul creatures who appear as wizened old women, hags share little in common with the humanoids they terrorize. They are hateful entities whose greatest joy lies in the corruption and ultimate destruction of anything good and virtuous. Whatever power created the first hags is lost to time, but numerous hag varieties have arisen over the ages, each with their own powers and abilities to spread pain and suffering.",

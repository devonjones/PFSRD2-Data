For a myceloid colony, any battle with humanoids is cause for excitement, as this new fodder presents so many delicious possibilities.  \n  \n Myceloids consider humanoids to have an ideal life cycle of four simple steps. During childhood, they wander naive and afraid, unaware of myceloid colonies. In adulthood, humanoids discover their true purpose as they taste purple pox and become enslaved by the myceloids' spores. Next, they die, giving rise to a new myceloid. They're then sent on to the afterlife upon becoming a myceloid meal. Eating humanoid flesh is not a necessity\u2014a myceloid can survive on any decaying matter\u2014but it's certainly a pleasure.  \n  \n Myceloids rarely make alliances, but when they do, they invite their new allies to share a meal to seal the pact. Few outsiders appreciate this hospitality. Most myceloids have deep purple caps studded with off-white lumps. Their necks and bodies bear resemblance to the stipes of tough, leathery fungi. Smaller mushrooms often grow on a myceloid's body, which the creatures view as either adornments or particularly convenient snacks. They stand roughly as tall as a dwarf, with comparably stout builds.",

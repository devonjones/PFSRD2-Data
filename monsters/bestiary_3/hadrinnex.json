They evolve at a rapid rate, but only to specific attacks against them, which suggests they were created through advanced technology or magic. The husk surrounding a hadrinnex\u2014flecks of metal suspended in a malleable organic carapace\u2014reshapes in response to harm. So too can a glowing gland within the creature's thorax, which collects energy and restructures the creature's biology to protect it from that energy. This organ is fragile and ruptures soon after a hadrinnex is killed.  \n  \n Hadrinnexes have only a rudimentary intellect and usually follow more intelligent aberrations. As bodyguards or peons, they perform simple tasks diligently. Though poor at problem-solving and improvisation, hadrinnexes' dependability and adaptive physiology make them ideal for dangerous tasks in hazardous environments.",

Either one expends the damage type stored in the hadrinnex's energy gland, as described below.   \nAfter the energy is vented, the energy gland goes dormant. The hadrinnex loses its energy resistance and can't use energy ray until it uses Rapid Evolution to reconfigure its energy gland again.

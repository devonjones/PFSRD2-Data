            "text": "Garudas are noble, birdlike beings descended from the gods. They were born under the cerulean skies of the Outer Plane of Elysium but have since spread to the Material Plane, and it is here that they primarily reside. On Golarion,the largest garuda populations live in the rugged hills and mountains of Vudra, though some have spread to the Impossible Kingdom of Jalmeray and even to the eastern mountains of Garund.  \n  \n Garudas usually roost in isolated aeries but spend much of their time gliding on the wind. Many garudas are nomadic or migratory, yearning to travel and soar above new landscapes. While they remain detached from humanoid societies, they are impetuous and gallant, frequently serving as protectors of communities near the cliffs and peaks where they roost. Some garudas instead combine their wanderlust and goodhearted nature by serving as messengers and emissaries between remote settlements, though most who take up this work abandon it after a few years when the same terrain becomes boring. Wandering garudas are no less compassionate, and many a tale tells of a garuda who came to the aid of a lost traveler or carried an endangered soul to safety.  \n  \n Though they hold most living creatures in high regard, garudas loathe ophidian creatures\u2014nagas in particular. Rarely do they come into contact without fighting, and a garuda will go out of their way to hunt down a naga if they hear even the tiniest hint of a rumor suggesting the presence of one.  \n  \n A garuda's feathering and coloration range widely depending on the terrain they favor. Garudas in temperate woodlands might resemble jays or falcons, while tropical garudas sport bright plumage.",

This guardianship extends to the Astral Plane as a whole, as shulsagas not only exile trespassers, but also seek out and close planar rifts. Especially egregious breaches rile these ennosites to the point of invasion, and shulsaga raiding parties often extend their attacks well beyond a portal to ensure the threat's utter destruction. Though often stern and standoffish, shulsagas occasionally befriend and recruit strangers to help them repair planar wounds and track down foes of the natural order.  \n  \n Among ennosites, shulsagas are the most inclined to adopt and nurture iotons, forming small family units. Communities work together to instill enough culture and identity for these iotons to take on permanent forms\u2014those of adolescent shulsagas. Each shulsaga's gender reflects of their evolving identity, influenced in part by the blend of traits their communities imparted and their own thoughts.",

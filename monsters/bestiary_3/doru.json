In the beginning, these genies were masters of creation, working alongside gracious mortal partners to create works of subtle design and powerful magical potential. What started as a collaboration with mortals soon morphed into abuse, disrespect, and even slavery and bondage. Eventually, these genies rebelled, but in doing so, they came under the sway of a nihilistic demigod known as Ahriman. Their new master twisted their form and granted them the power to avenge themselves upon their mortal overlords, leading to the birth of the first divs.  \n  \n Since that first wave of corruption, new divs arise from the spirits of the most wicked and hateful genies who die on the Material Plane, or those truly betrayed by mortals and overcome through their desire for vengeance. Upon such a death, instead of returning to the Elemental Planes, these genies' spirits are trapped in the dread orbit of Abaddon, where Ahriman reshapes them as divs and hoists them back to the world to wreak vengeance upon mortals.",

A creature can tempt a doru with some bit of obscure knowledge the doru doesn't know or thinks they don't know. Presenting the hint of the secret is a single action, which has the concentrate and linguistic traits, and requires a skill check using Deception, Lore, or Performance (or some other appropriate skill determined by the GM) against the doru's Will DC. On a success, the doru is fascinated for as long as the presenter draws out the explanation of the secret (spending 1 action each round doing so, to a maximum of 1 minute). On a critical success, the doru is fascinated for that duration plus 1 minute more as it ponders the implications of the secret. Regardless of the outcome, the doru is temporarily immune to that creature's attempts to present it with secrets for 1 day.",

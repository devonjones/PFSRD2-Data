These adept combatants form crossbows and bolts out of their emotional bonds, though they typically fight only to protect that which they love. While unable to speak given their featureless faces, they're nevertheless compassionate listeners and savvy communicators.  \n  \n Each love siktempora takes the form of two small humanoids conjoined at the hip with three legs, two arms, and two heads. Their faces are completely featureless except for a faint, ever present blush spread across their cheeks, and they always appear garbed in stylish garments from obscure civilizations.  \n  \n***Unspecific Lore***: DC 38  \n***Specific Lore***: DC 35",

A rare few, however, are created when an emotionally invested creature attempts to travel to the Dimension of Time or interferes with the flow of time, which can create paradoxes or manipulate past events.  \n  \n Siktemporas usually isolate themselves on the Dimension of Time in mindscapes infused with the emotion that created them, but some travel to other planes.

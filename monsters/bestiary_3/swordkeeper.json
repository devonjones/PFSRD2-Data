To create a swordkeeper with a different weapon, replace the versatile P trait from its echoblade Strikes with those of the new weapon, change the weapon damage dice to match, and apply any runes. Unless you want to significantly change the swordkeeper's level, you should also adjust the Strike damage to make sure it's not too high or too low.",

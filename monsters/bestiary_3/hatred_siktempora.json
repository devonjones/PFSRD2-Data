Fortunately for mortals, they typically limit their predations to the Dimension of Time, where they hunt down creatures foreign to that realm\u2014and some native to it.  \n  \n Hatred siktemporas appear roughly humanoid, but their gaunt forms resemble bone and tendon more than flesh and skin. Adding to their unnerving appearance, their legs have an additional segment between their shin and thigh, and likewise for their eerily long arms. Their featureless faces bear only a singular scar, which takes a different form on every hatred siktempora. They clad themselves in immaculate finery chosen from the most vitriolic empires that ever existed, in the past and the future, and they form a magical garrote as a manifestation of their cold malice.",

A rare few, however, are created when an emotionally invested creature attempts to travel to the Dimension of Time or interferes with the flow of time, which can create paradoxes or manipulate past events.  \n  \n Siktemporas usually isolate themselves on the Dimension of Time in mindscapes infused with the emotion that created them, but some travel to other planes.

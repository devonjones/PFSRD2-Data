No matter how he was entreated, he wouldn't share the water. So the animals instead tried to make him laugh\u2014to no avail. Routine by routine passed, but nothing worked. Finally, the snake couldn't take it any longer and began to berate Tiddalik, tying himself in knots in his anger. These contortions were what finally caused Tiddalik to laugh. He laughed for days and days\u2014a big, deep belly laugh\u2014spewing the precious water everywhere and flooding the lands. To this day Tiddalik is an emblem of greed in many stories, often petty when others have an abundance since his was taken away.",

Upon finding a source, the tiddalik submerges itself and begins to drink, and drink, and drink. Over time, it slurps the water down to the very last drop and balloons in size, becoming unable to move at more than an amble. The water sustains the tiddalik for years, while the land suffers a great drought. In fact, the only moisture to be found in any quantity might be the damp divot the tiddalik's great, sloshing body leaves behind as it travels.  \n  \n Desperate locals trying to undo a tiddalik's work are met with the creature's gullet or torrents of water. A tiddalik is lazy and unlikely to start a fight of its own volition or even to chase a fleeing attacker, having little interest in anything but slaking its immense thirst. In its death throes, the tiddalik divulges its water stores, breaking free in a final tide of mass destruction that swamps the surrounding area. Woe betide any unlucky enough to find themselves beset by a tiddalik's gluttony!",

Gliminals exude a constant aura of positive energy, suffusing everything they encounter without regard for whether a creature's body can withstand these excesses of positive energy.  \n  \n On the Positive Energy Plane they call home, gliminals view outsiders as unfortunate creatures afflicted with the malady called mortality. They seek to suffuse mortals with light and healing until they no longer suffer, and they consider those who explode into positive energy cured. Gliminals pulled to other planes, whether summoned or through interplanar rifts, find themselves overwhelmed, and usually lash out in increasingly desperate attempts to escape the oppressive onslaught of matter and negative energies.",

The damage has the same type and still applies the gliminal's immunities, resistances, and weaknesses.  \n The link remains until the target is more than 120 feet away, the gliminal falls unconscious, or the gliminal uses Bond in Light again."

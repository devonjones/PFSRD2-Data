They explore and protect the calmest boundaries of the icy regions of the Plane of Water, where ice forms in shiny, flawless sheets.  \n  \n Insatiably curious, their eagerness propels some ledaluscas to pickpocket interesting-looking objects to play with. Others travel to different planes to locate, observe, and reflect a wider variety of creatures than those on their home plane. They pretend to be ice sculptures or still pools for this purpose, especially if they can find a spot in a high-traffic area to inhabit. Despite their perfect mimicry, ledaluscas are unable to create an appearance from scratch, nor can they adjust the appearance they take on or combine elements of different reflections. Some of them find this disheartening, like artists vexed by a lack of creativity.  \n  \n One of the strangest encounters a ledalusca can experience is with a creature or object that has no reflection. A ledalusca can see a vampire, for example, but is unable to reproduce its image. For a creature that effectively has an unlimited memory for images, this proves utterly confusing. The vague memory of the encounter sticks in the ledalusca's mind like a splintering a humanoid's finger.",

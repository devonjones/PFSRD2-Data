The most infamous are mountain-dwelling yetis, but other regions hide even more elusive creatures, such as the orang pendek, yowie, almas, and yeren. Just as yetis and sasquatches have significantly different traits and abilities, it's likely these other creatures each possess their own unique abilities to help them remain in isolation.",

            "text": "The elusive sasquatches dwell in the deepest, most remote and secluded tracts of wilderness. They avoid confrontations with humanoids unless drawn out by curiosity. In such cases, glimpses through the underbrush are typically the best an onlooker can hope for, as sasquatches are perfectly content to live their lives in peace hidden in the deep thickets of the wild.  \n  \n Despite their considerable bulk, sasquatches are capable of moving through forests with surprising grace and efficiency. Often, their distinctively pungent odor or the discovery of a few sets of unusually oversized footprints are the only signs of their presence. These footprints have helped to engender a popular nickname, \u201cbigfoot,\u201d for these mysterious creatures.  \n  \n While normally nonconfrontational, a sasquatch can be driven to violence when startled or when their homeland is threatened, be it by the expansion of pioneers or the intrusion of fell supernatural influences. Usually, a sasquatch's attack lasts as long as it takes to frighten away a foe; they rarely pursue those who flee from their displays of dominance.  \n  \n Sasquatches speak their own language, which mixes sounds easily mistaken for ambient wildlife calls and knocking\u2014most often by striking a solid surface (such as a tree) with a branch or a stone\u2014allowing a whole family of sasquatches to carry on conversations without alerting nearby humanoids. Even in death they avoid leaving traces behind, for when a sasquatch dies, their kin take pains to bury the body deep and hide the grave site well to protect the remains from scavengers and evil spirits alike.",

This disguise is more than an illusion, for a blood hag wears the skin of a previous victim to hide her true appearance. During the day, her disguise is almost perfect, especially if the community knows nothing about the person the hag is pretending to be. But after sunset, the creature sheds her skin, hides it in a safe place, and stalks the night to drink the blood that sustains her.  \n  \n Able to travel quickly in the form of a ball of fire and to slip through keyholes or the slightest crack in a door or window, blood hags feed on sleeping victims then return home before morning to don their stolen skin.",

This requires a successful Athletics check against the victim's Fortitude DC if the victim is grabbed and is automatic for any of the other conditions. The victim becomes drained 1. The hag regains 15 Hit Points, gaining any excess HP as temporary Hit Points that last for 1 hour. Drinking blood from a creature that's already drained doesn't restore any Hit Points to the hag but increases the victim's drained value by 1, killing the victim when it reaches drained 5.  \n A victim's drained condition decreases by 1 per week. A blood transfusion, which requires a successful DC 20 Medicine check and sufficient blood or a blood donor, reduces the drained condition by 1 after 10 minutes."

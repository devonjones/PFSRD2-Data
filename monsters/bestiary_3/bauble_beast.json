They even try to infect one another with their respective skin conditions, as one beast might have sapphire-like warts and another emerald blotches, while a third has gold patches and another silver. The hosts of these social events often show off their wealth by catering expensive meals or sending lavish invitations.",

            "text": "The reclusive and deceptive creatures called bauble beasts create false jewelry as a byproduct of their extremely bizarre magical digestive systems. Two natural skin conditions provide the raw materials for this process: scaly patches of thin layers of metal, and warts that resemble gemstones. By chewing loose these patches and swallowing them, a bauble beast magically constructs the jewelry in its guts. After passing the forgery, it polishes and reshapes the item to make it more convincing. The beast then sneaks into a settlement to place the jewelry somewhere it can be found. A creature who dons this false jewelry is compelled to fetch their real valuables and deliver them to the beast, which it happily collects. Some bauble beasts simply send the confused victim on their way, but other more evil bauble beasts slay them to avoid being found out.  \n  \n This imitation jewelry fools laypeople, but it's infamous among merchants. Merchant training usually includes a brief course on detecting bauble beast jewelry's subtle but distinctive sweet odor.  \n  \n Though largely solitary, bauble beasts occasionally socialize with others who share their limited interests, primarily merchants, jewelers, earth elementals, and other bauble beasts. Xorns have a particular fondness for bauble beasts\u2014or at least their gems. Though these aren't as nourishing as real gems, xorns find the flavor decadent and eat them as a sort of junk food.",

Anyone who dons the imitation jewelry is targeted with a DC 24 *suggestion* spell with a duration of 1 hour on a failure or 24 hours on a critical failure. A creature that fails learns the location where the fake jewelry was created and is compelled to collect their valuable belongings and bring them to that location. Removing the imitation jewelry ends the spell immediately, but the wearer can't take it off voluntarily"

It slowly dissolves its captives in stomach acid until they can be digested. A slithering pit can go weeks without feeding, affording it patience.  \n  \n Thriving in dilapidated areas, slithering pits take up positions among the plentiful potholes where they can easily pass for just another blemish. They crawl across ramshackle cobblestone streets and damp underground complexes, waiting for unwary prey to stumble by and fall in.",

Any creature grabbed by the ooze falls in and is no longer grabbed, even if it was outside the pit squares. While a dimensional pit is open, the slithering pit is immobilized, can't be forced to move, and can make pseudopod Strikes originating from the walls of the pit. A creature that starts its turn at the bottom of the pit takes 2d6 acid damage. Climbing the walls of the pit requires a DC 22 Athletics check. When the slithering pit dies, the dimensional pit closes and creatures inside are ejected, with the effects of Out You Go."

A shapeless mass of smoke and shadow coils behind their broken masks. As abandoned zealots move, they spit and shriek a hateful cacophony of bitter lamentations and anguished weeping.  \n  \n Abandoned zealots are most commonly associated with the church of Razmir, which upholds a mortal wizard as a god\u2014a truth unknown to most worshippers. However, abandoned zealots might arise from a true religion if they've been misled about that faith's true tenets or aims. This situation could easily result from the cruel schemes and predations of sinister beings, such as shrine skelms and the blasphemous devils known as deimavigga.",

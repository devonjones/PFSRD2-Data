An owb prefers to select one caligni leader to control from the shadows, manipulating them using charisma and magic.

Some even believe owbs are the Forsaken manifested.  \n  \n A multitude of owbs visit and even remain to advise caligni communities, as varied in personality as the Forsaken. All owbs share a hatred of light and color, except for the flickering glow of the burning cold magic they can hurl as a weapon. Owbs who live among calignis tend to prohibit the use of light and color, using their curse of darkness to quench violators if necessary. The only other similarity across all owbs is their entrenched desire to manipulate their charges through mind-reading and deception, though such manipulation can be either subtle or overt.",

These effects have an unlimited duration. Regardless of the result of its save, the creature is temporarily immune for 1 minute.  \n If the owb uses this ability on a caligni, the curse can't be removed short of *wish* or similar powerful magic"

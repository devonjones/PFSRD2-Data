These swarms latch onto their prey, and the combined efforts of so many trilobites at once make escape difficult.",

The smallest trilobites are an inch or two long, while individuals measuring almost two feet long have been found in the depths of the ocean. Some hide in silt, using tall eyestalks to spot prey, while others have wide, sweeping, wing-like heads; certain kinds are even covered in spines. This variety in appearance has led to distinctive jewelry in seaside villages that imitates local trilobite populations.",

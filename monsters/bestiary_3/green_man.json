Druids consider the first green men to be the original source of the rituals for creating the less-deific leshys, and possibly even the arboreals and other intelligent plants. The affinity between leshys and green men is mutual. Leshys are the most likely ancestry to worship green man, and green men are particularly fond of their less-powerful kin",

When a forest or other woodland terrain generates enough nature spirits, beings of the same sort of vital essence that embodies leshy or answers the call of a commune with nature, they naturally coalesce together and apotheosize into a green man. Green men aren't concerned with all the multifarious processes of nature like Gozreh or many other nature deities. Instead, they focus nearly all their attention on the plants of their home, only concerning themselves with animals, minerals, and the like insomuch as they affect the plants. Despite their name, green men aren't necessarily male; as creatures of pure natural power, to many of them, the concept of gender holds no meaning, and to those that do, they can be of any gender.  \n  \n Most green men are neutral and tend to ignore \u201canimals,\u201d which to them include sapient creatures such as humans. However, good and evil green men do exist. These individuals are far more likely to attempt to spread their influence far and wide, either for good or ill. Good green men provide succor to all that come within their home, not only to plants, providing wisdom like a nurturing parent. Evil green men, however, allow rare and dangerous plants to thrive in their domains by spreading fear and devastation to all those who might threaten plant life, though they might keep a few animals around to hunt for sport.",

The swarms station multiple suitable corpses near the colony, and at least one swarm from the colony is always patrolling the nearby area in an inhabited corpse. This means that hellwasp colonies typically have a pervasive and noticeable stench of dead flesh around them. This also makes the treasure found near colonies highly random, consisting only of whatever possessions the inhabited corpse carried.",

While individual hellwasp poses little threat, these fist-sized insects instinctively form into aggressive swarms that will viciously attack any creature approaching their colony, the lone exception being powerful fiends.  \n  \n Hellwasp swarms have a rudimentary intelligence focused on the protection and expansion of their colony. They can understand Infernal but are incapable of speech. They sometimes obey simple commands from a lawful fiend more powerful than their swarm, but there is no nuance or understanding to this obedience, and if left alone for more than a day they stop obeying and return to their colony.",

The swarms station multiple suitable corpses near the colony, and at least one swarm from the colony is always patrolling the nearby area in an inhabited corpse. This means that hellwasp colonies typically have a pervasive and noticeable stench of dead flesh around them. This also makes the treasure found near colonies highly random, consisting only of whatever possessions the inhabited corpse carried.",

They can understand Infernal but are incapable of speech. They sometimes obey simple commands from a lawful fiend more powerful than their swarm, but there is no nuance or understanding to this obedience, and if left alone for more than a day they stop obeying and return to their colony.",

Its size changes to that of the corpse and it loses its piercing and slashing resistances, fly Speed, and Hellwasp Stings. It gains a fist melee Strike with a +18 attack modifier that deals 2d8 bludgeoning damage plus 2d8 piercing damage and hellwasp venom.  \n The hellwasp swarm gains 40 temporary Hit Points when it Infests a Corpse; when these temporary HP are depleted, the corpse falls apart and the swarm Abandons the Corpse automatically."

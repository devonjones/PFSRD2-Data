Over time, they developed a taste for sweets such as cupcakes, cookies, pie, wine, elderflower cordial, and the like. They can be expensive companions to feed, but it is easiest to befriend a harmona by tempting their curiosity with a sweet it hasn't had the pleasure of trying yet.",

A soft buzz accompanies them, discernible only to creatures with particularly keen hearing.  \n  \n Intelligent and curious, these tiny fey birds freely roam the First World, accompanying high-ranking fey creatures such as queens or their courts. In turn, companions who treat a harmona with respect for their knowledge and skill benefit from the harmona's aid in times of need.  \n  \n When these curious creatures find a natural gate between the planes, they glide through to explore and expand their knowledge. Those who find their way onto the Material Plane often choose to remain there in search of diverse and unusual places. This frequently leads them to the same locations that draw in curious adventurers. A harmona might befriend a non-fey adventurer as a companion, but they resent those who would treat them as pets and fight to the death to avoid capture.",

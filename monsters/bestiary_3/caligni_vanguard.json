Other calignis revere vanguards' discipline and combat skill, but wary caution always tinges such respect, as they often have inscrutable motives. Vanguards almost never rebel against their duties or their established role in the community; some claim that those who do are taken by the owbs.  \n  \n A vanguard's armor is fused to their body in pieces, and they rarely remove those elements that aren't. This armor plating and vanguards' keen sense of hearing render them particularly sensitive to sonic vibrations, which serves as both an asset and a vulnerability.",

Today, caligni still burst into light upon death, but their soul energy no longer feeds a mysterious pantheon of shadowy divinities.",

When all else fails, they literally vomit their disdain on passersby.  \n  \n Grimples resemble humanoid, mange-ridden opossums, with boar-like tusks that aid them in rooting through garbage heaps for food. They are agile climbers who glide from eave to eave on the loose flaps of skin between their limbs.

They believe they were raised to make their enemies pay for their demise, completely in denial to their own role in those events. Bereft of the henchmen and power they commanded while alive, the guecubu gleefully uses their new powers on those they hate. Many adventurers realize at some point that the guecubu pursuing them is a former foe they believed dispatched.",

Guecubus roams the land seeking those they deem responsible for their death.  \n  \n A guecubu remembers what was done to them, and the memories of their supposed mistreatment fuel their quest for revenge. Guecubus are well-equipped to exact such vengeance. Along with monstrous power and the ability to move through earth, they retain all the cunning they had in life.

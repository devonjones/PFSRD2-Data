Its gullet is so vast that elemental creatures have built permanent homes inside it, using remnants of shipwrecks. Some of these shipwrecks are quite curious, appearing to have come from other planes entirely, and suggesting the Void Mosasaur plied other waters over the course of its extensive life.",

A small set of secondary pterygoid jaws in their gullets pull in their meals for more efficient digestion. As air breathers, mosasaurs must stay near the surface of the water, competing for food with whales. This proximity to the surface means they often capsize small boats, feasting on the crew members who fall out.",

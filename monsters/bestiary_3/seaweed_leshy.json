They believe their freshwater counterparts to be sheltered and naive, living in their secluded ponds and babbling brooks, though this doesn't stop them from forming friendships with freshwater leshys.  \n  \n Seaweed leshys vary in size, shape, and physical makeup. While the majority of seaweed leshys reach about 2 feet in height, some remain as small bundles of strands that stand about 6 to 8 inches tall.",

Unless otherwise stated, polymorph spells don't allow the target to take on the appearance of a specific individual creature, but rather just a generic creature of a general type or ancestry.  \n  \n If you take on a battle form with a polymorph spell, the special statistics can be adjusted only by circumstance bonuses, status bonuses, and penalties. Unless otherwise noted, the battle form prevents you from casting spells, speaking, and using most manipulate actions that require hands. (If there's doubt about whether you can use an action, the GM decides.) Your gear is absorbed into you; the constant abilities of your gear still function, but you can't activate any items.",

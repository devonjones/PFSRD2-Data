Most tsukumogami are, by nature, mischievous, and oftentimes want nothing more than to occupy the attention of living creatures.  \n  \n Tsukumogami can commonly be found in areas with a strong cultural belief in the value of caring for objects, which helps items survive long enough to become tsukumogami. Towns and villages with large tsukumogami populations are referred to as \u201csleepless towns\u201d due to the nightly tsukumogami celebrations, which can become so raucous that they prevent the living residents from sleeping peacefully.",

Of course, some purists prefer genuine fossilized bones and are willing to pay the price for their acquisition. Either way, opportunities await enterprising souls with the proper tools and several *bags of holding*.",

Not bound to any specific model, fossil golems are crafted to be as terrifying as possible instead of models of anatomic accuracy. As such, most fossil golems are nightmarish saurian amalgams whose massive arms end with the complete skulls of apex predators like tyrannosauruses, their bite enhanced to petrify flesh.  \n  \n The enchantments that animate fossil golems grant them a form of modular flexibility, letting them trade mobility for extended reach through the rapid rearrangement of their limbs. This also lets them appear like a jumbled mass of bones at rest, making them likely to be mistaken for decor rather than guardians.",

There exist two known methods of animating a golem. The traditional method involves harvesting and implanting an elemental soul or essence within the newly crafted host statue, a procedure seen as vile and blasphemous to those who value the sanctity of the soul; evil or amoral golem crafters tend to prefer this method. The other, less disreputable technique involves siphoning pure positive energy into the statue to artificially imitate the creation of a soul. The result does not give the golem a true soul and is generally a more costly and time-consuming method of creation. Regardless of the method used, the resulting golem functions the same. A golem's unique animating force leaves it susceptible to certain forms of magic, but apart from these few weaknesses, it is impervious to magic and difficult to damage with weapons.  \n  \n Golems work best in play as foes to vanquish rather than allies to accompany player characters on adventures. The process of creating a golem is time-consuming, expensive, and difficult, and only the most talented spellcasters or artisans can even hope to accomplish such an undertaking. While certain magical texts\u2014so-called \u201cgolem manuals\u201d\u2014are said to aid golems crafters, for the most part the creation of a golem should be something left in the hands of the Game Master.  \n  \n Golems have components that can be harvested as trophies or magical components; the value depends on the golem in question. Examples of components that can be harvested from golems are listed in the sidebars.",

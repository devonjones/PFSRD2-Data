Fire planes are extremely hostile to non-fire creatures.

Extraplanar creatures take moderate environmental fire damage at the end of each round (sometimes minor environmental damage in safer areas, or major or massive damage in even more fiery areas). Ice creatures are extremely uncomfortable on a fire plane, assuming they don\u2019t outright melt in the heat.",

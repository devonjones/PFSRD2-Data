Every crossroads guardian exists to satisfy a particular need\u2014usually a quest that must be carried out, helpless individuals who must be saved from harm, or an object or location which must be guarded. Although they often appear at actual crossroads, a crossroads guardian can materialize anywhere there is a community, from a giant metropolis to a lizardfolk village in a remote swamp.  \n  \n Some crossroads guardians are martial beings\u2014defending a mystic fountain against all intruders, for example\u2014but most are helpers and assistants, guiding heroes through the wilderness to where they're needed. A guardian is a skilled warrior and can defend a location, but when its purpose involves a quest, or the need is so great that the guardian isn't up to the task alone, the guardian must persuade others to voluntarily accept their quest.  \n  \n Once a crossroads guardian has fulfilled its purpose, it either shifts to satisfy a new need or quest\u2014often changing its alignment and abilities as well\u2014or else slowly vanishes, returning to the raw primal magic from which it was formed.",

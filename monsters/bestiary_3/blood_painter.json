Blood painter physiology can't digest typical food, so the creatures feed by harvesting blood and using it to paint and animate something edible.  \n  \n When not on the hunt, blood painters seek out beautiful vistas, which they placidly admire via the eyes in the hands of their uppermost limbs and then reproduce on canvas. Exceptional art endlessly fascinates these creatures, and skilled dancers and painters alike occasionally escape the aberrations by creating a new work to trade for their lives. Blood painters jealously guard these works, and much of their treasure consists of art. Blood painters tend to mastermind the periodic theft of masterpieces.",

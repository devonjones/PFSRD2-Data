Instead of jaws, trilobites have specialized structures called gnathobases at the base of some of their legs. These serrated and jagged structures grind and masticate any prey the trilobite latches onto, enabling the creatures to feed on anything from hard-shelled clams to soft-bodied creatures. While not particularly fast on their own, they can employ scuttling bursts of speed to dart into ocean silt or seaweed beds to escape predators.  \n  \n Oceanic wizards of many types employ trilobites as familiars. In addition to trilobites' durability, their ubiquity means they make capable spies for their masters as they travel unnoticed throughout the depths.",

The smallest trilobites are an inch or two long, while individuals measuring almost two feet long have been found in the depths of the ocean. Some hide in silt, using tall eyestalks to spot prey, while others have wide, sweeping, wing-like heads; certain kinds are even covered in spines. This variety in appearance has led to distinctive jewelry in seaside villages that imitates local trilobite populations.",

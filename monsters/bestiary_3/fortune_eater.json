A fortune eater is a collective entity that might lurk near fortune tellers, taverns, or Pathfinder Society lodges where adventurers are likely to pass through. The spirit then follows the heroes on their quests until the right moment, when the spirit manifests their unfortunate abilities to get the party killed and potentially add them to the collective. Sometimes they linger near the lairs of a powerful monster, waiting for parties of unwary adventurers.  \n  \n A fortune eater lingers because of unfinished business: to move on, they must help a hero defeat a great threat or acquire a legendary item. Ironically, their jealousy, rage, and powers of bad luck make this extremely unlikely.",

When inside an object, an incorporeal creature can\u2019t perceive, attack, or interact with anything outside the object, and if it starts its turn in an object, it is slowed 1. Corporeal creatures can pass through an incorporeal creature, but they can\u2019t end their movement in its space.  \n  \n An incorporeal creature can\u2019t attempt Strength-based checks against physical creatures or objects\u2014only against incorporeal ones\u2014unless those objects have the _ghost touch_ property rune. Likewise, a corporeal creature can\u2019t attempt Strength-based checks against incorporeal creatures or objects.  \n  \n Incorporeal creatures usually have immunity to effects or conditions that require a physical body, like disease, poison, and precision damage. They usually have resistance against all damage (except force damage and damage from Strikes with the _ghost touch_ property rune), with double the resistance against non-magical damage.",

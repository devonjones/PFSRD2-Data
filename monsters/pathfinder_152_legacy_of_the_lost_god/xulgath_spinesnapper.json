Most xulgaths call such siblings spinesnappers, though terms like bonebreaker, marrowvent, or similarly violent epithets are equally common. A typical spinesnapper is 9 feet tall and weighs 350 pounds.<br/><br/> In battle, spinesnappers have all the speed, grace, and strength of a sledgehammer. They are ideal shock troops and make a good first line of defense. When an inter-clutch conflict leads to a duel, spinesnappers are typically called upon to rise to the challenge. In this case, a spinesnapper representative from each clutch squares off for what is in theory a nonlethal wrestling match, after which the winner scrapes off some of the loser\u2019s scales as a trophy.<br/><br/><b><u><a aonid=\"5\" game-obj=\"Skills\" general=\"true\">Recall Knowledge - Humanoid</a></u> (<u><a aonid=\"14\" game-obj=\"Skills\">Society</a></u>)</b>: DC 20"

They live in simple familial communities, battling rival groups and other aggressive Darklands inhabitants in order to survive. They occasionally raid surface settlements, usually at the behest of cruel, bloodthirsty leaders who are often themselves in the thrall of more powerful creatures like nagas or demons. A typical xulgath has dull gray, dark gray, or ashen scales, with a long tail and bony protrusions that run the length of its spine. A typical xulgath is 5 feet tall and weighs 150 pounds.<br/><br/> Although today the xulgaths are brutal and scattered, they were one of the first intelligent humanoids to rise in the primeval world, once ruling over a mighty empire that stretched throughout the Darklands. Today, all that remains of this era are ruins of massive stone ziggurats and crumbling cities found within some of the larger caverns. Some groups of xulgaths continue to live among these ruins, venerating their ancestors\u2019 accomplishments, while others consider these areas taboo and leave them to become infested with Darklands vermin. Sages don\u2019t agree on why the ancient xulgath civilization fell. Some suspect it was the result of a loss of several wars waged against serpentfolk, while others suggest that the corruptive influence of demon worship rotted their culture from within.<br/><br/> Certainly, many xulgath settlements continue to worship demons to this day, paying homage and offering live sacrifices to terrible creatures from the Abyss. Occasionally, a xulgath shaman can call forth and bind a lesser demon to help serve the group, but a shaman who delves too deep into occultism might summon a more powerful fiend that either tears the xulgaths to pieces or enslaves them."

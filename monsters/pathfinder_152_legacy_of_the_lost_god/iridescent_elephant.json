Although the effect is glamorous, the life of an iridescent animal is a sad one. The change drastically weakens the animal, diminishing both its strength and its vitality. This effect is desirable for some\u2014particularly the circuses, menageries, and royal courts that typically purchase these glowing beasts\u2014but never for the animal itself. Because the effects of the transformation are so deleterious, the act of creating an iridescent animal is strongly frowned upon by druids and other naturalists, some of whom dedicate their lives to rescuing and fostering these maltreated creatures. The procedure cannot be reversed, and few iridescent animals are fit to live in the wild after the transformation, cementing their lot in life to serve as showy beasts of burden or objects of entertainment and ridicule.",

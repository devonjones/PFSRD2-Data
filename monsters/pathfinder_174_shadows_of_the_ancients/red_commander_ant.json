Although no red commander can give orders to another, they nevertheless work in an eerie coordination to fulfill their missions as effectively as possible. They have a sense of adaptability and self-preservation that might lead them to abandon a dangerous task, even if doing so costs the lives of lower-ranking ants. Red commanders tend to show glimmers of individuality that other red ants don't, such as by marking their chitinous exoskeletons with commemorations of past battles and martial victories.",

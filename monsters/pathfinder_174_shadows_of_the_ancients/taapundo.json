A thrown weapon, ammunition, or other unattended item automatically transforms; the wielder of an attended object can resist this effect with a successful DC 41 Fortitude save. *Dispel magic* can end the effect. While a weapon is wood, the ta'apundo's resistance applies. Once transformed, a formerly metal item's Hardness and HP change to those of wood. This typically inflicts a \u20132 circumstance penalty to attack rolls made with metal weapons and a \u20132 circumstance penalty to AC for those wearing metal armor; the GM might determine a different penalty for a specific weapon or armor.",

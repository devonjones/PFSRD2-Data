The first quickening pulses of animation in acid-pitted flesh are easy enough to end with counteracting chemicals or even isolation and starvation, but most crawling slurries are left to fester for a long time and become as large as a person. Left untended in a vat of nutritive acids and organic matter, a crawling slurry might become truly immense, but the power such a slithering horror holds is beyond comprehension.",

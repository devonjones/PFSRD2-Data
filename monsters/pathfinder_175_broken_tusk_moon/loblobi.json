Since other loblobis rarely put up with this treatment, they don't often gather in groups. Loblobis particularly like to have companion creatures they find ugly, as they think it makes them look all the more regal by comparison. The one curious exception are gremlins; though loblobis hate gremlins' appearance, they don't want anything to do with gremlins, who they viciously drive away from their rivers and shores.",

Fey native to such rivers are often just as capricious. This quality is particularly true of loblobis, cunning carnivores who resemble small, chubby humans with the heads and wings of crested herons.  \n  \n These malicious tricksters love playing any pranks that result in other creatures being embarrassed, hurt, or even drowned. Their most common \u201cantic\u201d is to cast *water walk* on a hopeful river-crosser, only to dismiss the spell when their victim has traversed halfway across. Conversely, most loblobis are terrible sports when they're the butt of a joke. It's common wisdom that few creatures can hold a grudge like a loblobi.  \n  \n Exceptionally vain, loblobis flutter and dance constantly to show off their plumage. Failing to comment on a preening loblobi's appearance is a sure method to invite eternal enmity, but flattery might buy enough time to sneak away from the evil fey.",

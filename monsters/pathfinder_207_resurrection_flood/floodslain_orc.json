Water flows endlessly from a floodslain creature, making the area around it slippery. The ground in the aura is difficult terrain for all non-floodslain creatures.  \n **Swimmer** Despite their ungainly appearance, floodslain are excellent swimmers.

The surprise and terror these victims of the Deluge feel during their last moments is sometimes enough to raise them from the dead as floodslain. As the waters that killed them recede, the undead seek others to join them. Despite their broken, shattered bodies, floodslain are often recognizable to those who knew them in life.  \n  \n Floodslain creatures are rare outside Belkzen, leading some scholars to speculate that the waters of the Deluge are somehow cursed. Others believe the proximity of Gallowspire could be the cause. If so, this means the Gravelands could soon see floodslain arise there too, as the Whispering Tyrant furthers his plots after escaping that prison.",

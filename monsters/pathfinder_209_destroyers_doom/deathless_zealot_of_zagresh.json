They're as ambitious as deathless hierophants but more martially oriented, seeking out and slaying alleged heretics and enemies of their faith in pursuit of completing their divine missions. This zealot is dedicated to Zagresh, but any deity of warfare could create a deathless zealot. Due to their focus on battle and conflict, orc deities are especially likely to create deathless zealots in preference to other forms of deathless acolytes.",

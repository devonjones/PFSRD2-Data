            "text": "A guhdggi forms from the corrupted reincarnated souls of those who have trod the same pilgrimage route through multiple lives. This type of nindoru looks like a bloated frog with long, slender human arms instead of front feet. Its eyes appear bulbous and blind yet are capable of sight. A guhdggi always carries a large wicker cage strapped to their back, while dozens of cords and straps affix a trove of broken weapons, tools, and items to their belly and flanks. When they walk, they do so with the aid of two long spears clutched in their forearms, stumbling and hopping in an ungainly gait. The most unsettling feature of the guhdggi is its second face, revealed when the frog-like mouth opens to reveal a human face peering from its throat amid a tangled nest of butterflies. This face has long, dark, animated hair capable of inflicting painful lashes, the lengths of which hang from the corner of the frog's mouth when its lips are closed.  \n  \n While the guhdggi is no longer capable of movement as swift as most humanoids walk, they still enjoy traveling while harboring a ferocious jealousy of those who can do so with greater ease. One would do well not to underestimate the stumbling stagger of a guhdggi, though! The fiend particularly delights in lying in wait along isolated sections of pilgrimage routes to ambush travelers, trapping victims in their cages and feeding upon their captive's mind and memories of previously visited places.  \n  \n Guhdggis embody the cycles of repeated journeys and the concept that every journey taken ends at the start of the next. Central to this concept is the notion that no journey ever truly begins or ends\u2014they just emerge from the previous one.",

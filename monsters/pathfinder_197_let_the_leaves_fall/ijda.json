            "text": "Ijdas are creatures of forgetfulness. Born from souls who were once enlightened but then renounced it and their role in the cycle of reincarnation, they curse the futility of their existence and find pleasure in leading others to the same fate.  \n  \n Ijdas appear as towering humanoids, their bodies bloated and constantly bursting with small red butterflies that flitter away before melting into mist. Their arms are overly long and so broken as to writhe more like tentacles, affording them an unsettling combat style with greater reach than most large creatures enjoy. They wear clothing and capes made of moldy straw and wield broken swords whose shattered blades still float roughly in place. Their most unsettling features are their complete lack of heads; instead, where a head should be sits a wicker cage filled with a writhing cloud of butterflies. Yet still, they see, hear, and speak without issue, as if their heads remained in place.  \n  \n Formed without heads or even brains, an idja's mind is shared among the flocks of butterflies in their head cages or bursting from their bodies, and as each of these insects escapes and fades away, these forgetful fiends lose another potential thought. Unable to learn new things, any actions they take stem from memories etched into their souls or directives they blindly follow from other nindorus or creatures they've come to accept as superiors. Their movements, words, and reactions are all conducted via a type of muscle memory based on how their souls believe they should respond to their external stimuli. As a result, most now serve as brutal guardians, since their forgetfulness also prevents them from being able to sleep.",

            "text": "A sojiruh comes into existence when a creature who has dedicated multiple lives to achieving enlightenment turns their back on these goals and deliberately tears themselves away from the cycle of reincarnation before their death. These monstrous creatures are the most common nindoru and are also the most hated by followers of Sangpotshi, since so many of these fiends rise from fallen members of that very philosophy.  \n  \n This type of nindoru relishes the flavor of an oft-reincarnated soul and finds this life force tastes best when consumed while the physical body still lives and screams. To sojiruhs, the sound of a perfect scream from the body it feeds upon is akin to the perfect wine pairing with dinner.  \n  \n A sojiruh's mouth is stitched shut with lengths of its own hair. Despite this, they can speak freely, their hollow- sounding voices issuing clearly from sealed lips. They only stretch these stitches when they choose to shriek and scream. Their arms are long and broken-looking, while their chests are little more than rib cages filled with red wet butterflies that crawl through and cling to the creature's ribs and organs. When a sojiruh screams, the wings of the butterflies in its chest flutter frantically. Sojiruhs symbolize the cycle of reincarnation come undone from its purity and becoming mired in decay and corruption.",

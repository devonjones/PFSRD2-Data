This hunger drives the meokdan to constantly seek food and often compels them to eat dirt, stones, and refuse that offer little (if any) nutritional value. Regardless of how much they eat, a meokdan always remains painfully thin in stature. Regardless of how hungry they get, they never starve to death.  \n  \n A meokdan's emaciated frame appears human in shape, with thick, tangled hair that grows directly from their face as well as the rest of their head, leaving only the meokdan's gaping mouth visible. Their arms appear to be broken and unnaturally long, with equally long fingers tipped with ragged nails. Small, open sores pockmark their skin.  \n  \n Meokdans epitomize the cycle of food, from consumption to the creature themselves being consumed in the end, be it by predators or the environment growing from their remains.",

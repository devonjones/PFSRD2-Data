            "text": "Vegetable lambs are gaining popularity as the first elemental to be summoned by spellcasters in training, as they're docile until provoked and easy to control. Casters must take care, however, to not let them germinate in the Universe; they're a highly invasive species that can devour an entire forest within a decade.  \n  \n The healing and nourishing food that grows from vegetable lambs is appealing for adventurers and sedentary magical scholars alike. The taste is similar to the plants of the same kind that grow on Golarion, but not entirely. Many have noted that there's a slight similarity to meat\u2014a bit of umami one wouldn't find in an ordinary flower.",

The woods can be a dangerous place.  \n  \n Though some resemble animals, the elemental beasts presented here are still plants, and their life cycles reflect it. Vegetable lambs grow on rooted stalks, from which they can't be removed until they've matured (or perhaps ripened), leaving them dependent on their immediate surroundings for food. Moss sloths are little more than lumps of green fluff for the first century of their existence, only gaining limited mobility once they can grow their defensive wooden claws.",

In the strongest areas of a vitality plane, they could take moderate or even major vitality damage instead. While this might seem safe for living creatures, vitality planes present a different danger. Living creatures regain an amount of HP each round equal to the environmental damage undead take in the same area. If this would bring the living creature above their maximum HP, any excess becomes temporary HP. Unlike normal, these temporary HP combine with each other, and they last until the creature leaves the plane. If a creature\u2019s temporary HP from a vitality plane ever exceeds its maximum HP, it explodes in a burst of overloaded vitality energy, spreading across the area to birth new souls.",

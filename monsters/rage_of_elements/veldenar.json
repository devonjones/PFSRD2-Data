            "text": "Some dangers lurking within the Endless Sky can doom prey before they even realize it; such are the ambush tactics of the 20-foot-tall elementals known as veldenars. Their inherent invisibility and pale, almost translucent forms make them among the most deadly creatures to call the Plane of Air home.  \n  \n Veldenars resemble amphibians from the Universe, albeit with myriad red eyes and an affinity for cold. Hunting along the edges of eternal storms, the event horizons of dead zones, and the banks of sky streams, veldenars prey on the lesser denizens of their home plane. They can often be found using their natural buoyancy to drift among the large chunks of magical ice that crossed onto the Plane of Air from its former border with the Plane of Water. There, they extend their tongues to trap unwary flying insects or adventurers who might happen to float by. Their multiple eyes keep watch for their next meal even while devouring current prey.  \n  \n The intense cold of a veldenar's stomach rapidly incapacitates its victims, allowing the predator to focus on returning to invisibility and finding a secluded spot to digest. Victims who escape the veldenar's stomach often feel chilled to the bone for days.  \n  \n Veldenars aren't discerning about who or what they inhale. As a result, kinds of scrap can collect in their stomachs, especially inorganic material. Those hunting veldenars often wait until the elemental needs to regurgitate debris, as this is one of the few times a veldenar can be caught in a compromising position, unable to capture anything due to their clogged esophagus.",

Creatures with this trait consist primarily of air or have a connection to magical air.   \n  \nPlanes with this trait consist mostly of open spaces and air of various levels of turbulence, though they also contain rare islands of floating stone and other elements and energies. Air planes usually have breathable atmospheres, though they might include clouds of acidic or toxic gas. Earth creatures often find themselves at a disadvantage within air planes, as there\u2019s little solid ground for them to gain their bearings, which tends to at least make them uncomfortable.",

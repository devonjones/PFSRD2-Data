A green regiment loses juice shower and weakness to fire, and a rotten regiment's juice shower makes the creature sickened 1 if it fails a DC 25 Fortitude save instead of the normal effect.",

Over the course of decades, a regiment tree's branches grow heavy, laden with fruits uncannily shaped like people.

Their efforts instill tactical knowledge in these fruit warriors so they're prepared to fight as soon as they fall from the tree\u2014which they do simultaneously, forming one battle-ready unit. Each soldier is equal in skill and similar in form, with a wooden outer shell that splits into portions as the flesh of the fruit inside ripens. A slain warrior contains seeds within its body that can slowly germinate in rich soil with enough water\u2014or blood. Every battlefield can become a new garden.",

Thus, identifying a brass bastion's original crafter is a valued skill. Few non-ifrits dare trade in brass bastion scraps, save in extralegal markets.",

            "text": "Brass bastions are formidable sentinels crafted from elemental fire and extraplanar brass. While they can be shaped into many forms, most depict muscular warriors with curving horns and stern or taunting expressions. Within each brass shell is a raging inferno\u2014the source of its ceaseless heat. Though ifrits originally created brass bastions to act as servants and guards, the knowledge of how to craft them has spread throughout the Plane of Fire. They can even be found on the Plane of Earth thanks to interplanar trade. In Medina Mudii'a, brass bastions walk the streets, tend shops, and stand guard. Bespoke brass bastions are passed down as family heirlooms or gifted to business partners and allies. Scions of the wealthiest ifrit lineages never travel without a train of brass bastions clad in family livery. Destroying a rival ifrit's brass bastion is a quick way to erode their political status, though anyone caught performing such sabotage faces swift retribution.  \n  \n Most brass bastions prominently display the sigil of their owner or maker, though magical methods can also determine who crafted a specific construct. Brass bastions forged by favored artisans are a status symbol in many ifrit communities. Ifrits consider a brass bastion crafted by a non-ifrit to be inherently inferior, barely worth the cost of its materials. Brass bastions obey magical programming imprinted at the time of their creation or follow commands from their owners. Most can't speak, but a few have magical voices and can parrot simple phrases, recite poetry, or tell bedtime stories at the crafter's fancy.",

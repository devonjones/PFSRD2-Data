Creating a snapdrake requires first painstakingly constructing a frame of living wood in the shape of a drake before weaving thousands of colorful snapdragon flowers into intricate patterns to form its body and scales. Once complete, snapdrakes often serve kizidhars as a combination of guards, pets, and decorations for as long as they are well fed.",

The woods can be a dangerous place.  \n  \n Though some resemble animals, the elemental beasts presented here are still plants, and their life cycles reflect it. Vegetable lambs grow on rooted stalks, from which they can't be removed until they've matured (or perhaps ripened), leaving them dependent on their immediate surroundings for food. Moss sloths are little more than lumps of green fluff for the first century of their existence, only gaining limited mobility once they can grow their defensive wooden claws.",

The guardians absolutely loathe the light, though it doesn't harm them as it does some varieties of creatures. Though wary of both light and any interloping lifeforms in their natural habitat, a nightwood guardian's fear turns easily to wrath, making the guardian a force of fury who seeks to drive out intruders.  \n  \n***Unspecific Lore***: DC 26  \n***Specific Lore***: DC 23",

They're highly territorial toward both strangers and each other, able to detect an intruder through the ripples in the water. Due to their diet, ore lice have incredibly tough chitin that's infused with metal. Cannibalism between ore lice is common when they're unable to locate other prey.  \n  \n Though there are far more suitable environments for ore lice bordering the Plane of Air, the creatures are often found where the Plane of Earth meets the Plane of Water. This was a mystery that puzzled many\u2014until the Plane of Metal returned between the Planes of Earth and Water. Planar researchers realized that ore lice must have hunted here before the planar schism. On the Plane of Metal, ore lice often appear in horror stories chasing down metal elementals and ferociously devouring them. Their connection to Ferrumnestra adds to their infamy.",

Though they're able to carve themselves similarly, they usually regard their own forms as perfect.  \n  \n Shunning the company of other genies, they prefer to avoid those equal in power and instead surround themselves with circles of sycophants and flatterers. With the pathways to the Universe open again for the first time in ages, kizidhars roam the multiverse to find mortals they can tempt into joining their palace retinues as servants, entertainers, and valuable sources of new information.  \n  \nKizidhars look like walking trees, averaging 10 to 12 feet tall with branches twisting to form their arms, faces, and other features. A kizidhar can reshape their body to create any wooden object.",

Unless otherwise stated, polymorph spells don't allow the target to take on the appearance of a specific individual creature, but rather just a generic creature of a general type or ancestry.  \n  \n If you take on a battle form with a polymorph spell, the special statistics can be adjusted only by circumstance bonuses, status bonuses, and penalties. Unless otherwise noted, the battle form prevents you from casting spells, speaking, and using most manipulate actions that require hands. (If there's doubt about whether you can use an action, the GM decides.) Your gear is absorbed into you; the constant abilities of your gear still function, but you can't activate any items.",

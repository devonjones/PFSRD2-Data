Given a mind and a semblance of a face, comozant wyrds need a surface from which they can crackle and writhe. Once secure, they seek out companionship from anyone nearby. In the Universe, they can be found in many places: lashing themselves to sailing ships, dancing across the buildings, or anchoring to the stones of a mountain range. In the vast spans of the Plane of Air, however, comozant wyrds often come to feel extremely lonely. A lucky few become pets for jaathooms living in the plane's cities, but many wait on isolated floating islands for an airship they can attach to or, more tragically, strive vainly to reach a distant shore before sputtering out.",

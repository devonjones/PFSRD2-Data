Some excavated sites might still hold a sliver of consciousness in their base materials, which walks again as an avatar of an extinct people when awakened. These lithic loci represent the triumphs and folly of their society. Speaking to one is speaking to a witness of an archaic time. The lithic locus's persona expresses their culture in all dimensions, and thus the attitudes of lithic loci vary greatly. Their appearances show the aesthetics and technology of their time, suspended in a cloud of excavated earth.  \n  \n As plentiful as archaeological sites are in the Universe, the Plane of Earth holds countless more of far older provenance. Some of its inhabitants have even found lithic loci from peoples far older than themselves, seeing directly what would remain should they dwindle out of living memory. This has led some civilizations to even plan their decline by leaving a legacy in the living rock.",

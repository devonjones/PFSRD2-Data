However, a skilled alchemist can sometimes extract trace amounts of the valuable skymetal from its remains. This is a 10-minute process that requires the Alchemical Crafting feat, a proficiency rank of expert or better in Crafting, and a successful DC 20 Crafting check. A successful attempt produces a single *djezet dose* that remains potent for 1 hour before breaking down into a foul-smelling goo. The item has no value if sold due to its temporary nature.",

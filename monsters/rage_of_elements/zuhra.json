The few mortals who've gotten to know a zuhra often describe them as bombastic but emotionally aloof.  \n  \n Since the reconnection with other planes, zuhras have sought out and formed bonds with other genies. They find their jabali cousins to be capable smithing partners, if a bit staid and dull.

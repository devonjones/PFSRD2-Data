Shuyookhs view their desires as greater than those around them, leading them to provide aid as quickly and efficiently as possible, fulfilling the terms of bargains expediently and to the letter.  \n  \n Jabali shuyookhs are industrious and have many interests, including athletic competitions, engineering, jewelry-making, masonry, metalworking, and sculpting. They enjoy games of chance and bargaining, whether in a gambling hall, arena, or marketplace. Some mix their interests by managing organizations or guilds involving such concerns. Many shuyookhs reap the wealth of the Plane of Earth for sale elsewhere and speculate on the value of such commodities.",

If it comes under the effect of a second polymorph effect, the second polymorph effect attempts to counteract the first. If it succeeds, it takes effect, and if it fails, the spell has no effect on that target. Any Strikes specifically granted by a polymorph effect are magical. Unless otherwise stated, polymorph spells don't allow the target to take on the appearance of a specific individual creature, but rather just a generic creature of a general type or ancestry.  \n  \n If you take on a battle form with a polymorph spell, the special statistics can be adjusted only by circumstance bonuses, status bonuses, and penalties. Unless otherwise noted, the battle form prevents you from casting spells, speaking, and using most manipulate actions that require hands. (If there's doubt about whether you can use an action, the GM decides.) Your gear is absorbed into you; the constant abilities of your gear still function, but you can't activate any items.",

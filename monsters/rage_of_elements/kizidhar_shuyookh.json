Any genie noble (save for jann, who lack this power) can grant a mortal or undead creature up to three wishes within a year\u2019s time. Many unscrupulous creatures compel genie nobles to serve them, tricking them or entrapping them with magic.

Unless otherwise noted, the battle form prevents you from casting spells, speaking, and using most manipulate actions that require hands.

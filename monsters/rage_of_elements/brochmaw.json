Brochmaws love amphibian meat, though the origin of this appeal is a mystery. They will eagerly consume geniekin of all kinds because the magical blood produces a psychedelic effect. Brochmaws think celestials are as dangerous as they are delicious, requiring a precise cooking process to avoid killing the consumer. Most brochmaws are far too impatient to prepare celestial meat properly, often to disastrous results.",

Behind their maw burns a powerful internal oven, where the elemental creatures roast their prey.  \n  \n Brochmaws are driven solely by their voracious appetites, only leaving their lairs to acquire new meals. Early attempts to force brochmaws into service resulted in their would-be captors being reduced to nothing more than ash on a plate, accompanied by a written review of how they tasted. Now, brochmaws are employed all across the Planes, lured by the sweet promise of new, fresh meat.  \n  \n Though brochmaws have no use for money, they do trade gifts for services. The only thing they have to offer is cooked meat from their own mouths, which they deem extremely valuable. Surprisingly, all who have tried brochmaw meat claim it to be a savory roasted delight. Given that brochmaws offer nothing but cooked meat and desire nothing but raw meat, trading with them is a simple if slightly dangerous affair, often coming down to the quantity and rarity of the meat offered.  \n  \n Brochmaws hate to see meat go to waste. If one discovers a carcass of any sort, they call others of their kind to join them in a festive cookout, with dancing and feasting inevitably accompanied by compliments or complaints about the quality of the food.",

While brain oozes aren't much more powerful than an id ooze, they tend to be much crueler and more sadistic in their behavior. Brain oozes appear as disembodied brains that lash out with slimy tentacles. Where the id ooze possesses occult magic that allows them to confuse and hinder thought, brain oozes specialize in controlling thoughts and revels in the resulting feelings of superiority before, inevitably, they consume their mind-controlled victims.",

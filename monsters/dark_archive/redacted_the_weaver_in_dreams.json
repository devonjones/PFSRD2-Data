Unless the target succeeds at a DC 36 Will save, their astral form is pulled out, causing a ghostly image of them to appear in an adjacent space of the Weaver's choosing. An astral body is immune to physical damage but affected normally by mental effects, force effects, and effects that directly target the spirit. The target remains connected to their physical body by a silver cord, which is always visible and possibly foils attempts to Hide. Separation from one's astral body takes a toll on the psyche, imposing a \u20131 status penalty to Will saves and dealing 1d6 persistent mental damage for as long as the body is separated; this increases to 3d6 if the target is ever more than 30 feet from its astral body. The target can use a single action, which has the concentrate trait, to move their astral body an amount equal to their Speed. When the target stops taking persistent mental damage from this ability, the astral body snaps back to the physical body, ending the effect. If a target is carrying silver, then the first time this ability is used on them, the ability fails and any silver they're carrying larger than a coin tarnishes\u2014while this doesn't outright destroy items like weapons or thaumaturge implements, it does prevent them from protecting against this ability more than once."

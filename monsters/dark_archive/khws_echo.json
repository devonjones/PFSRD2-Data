The threads deal 7d6 slashing damage and 7d6 mental damage to all creatures in a 30-foot emanation, with a DC 34 basic Reflex save. If a creature fails its save, the threads awaken the mindscape anchor within it, affecting it differently based on which anchor that creature used to gain access to the center of the mindscape. (If there is a PC who didn't absorb a mindscape anchor, for instance because there are more than four PCs in the party, then use the anchor of the PC closest to them.) The Echo then can't use Spindle's Web for 1d4 rounds. \n* **Lantern** The lantern outlines the creature with searing *faerie fire* that deals 2d6 persistent fire damage.\n* **Mirror** The mirror reflects the creature to another location, teleporting them to a clear space within 25 feet of their current location.\n* **Chalice** The chalice drains life force, granting the Echo temporary HP equal to half the damage dealt.\n* **Tome** The tome floods the creature's mind with information; the target is slowed 1 for 1 round."

In life, a llorona may have contributed to the child's death or simply lost the child to a horrible accident. In death, a llorona's pain manifests as a malevolent desire to drown others, imparting the same grief that they share with the person's loved ones. To this end, lloronas remain along riversides and other bodies of water in hopes of drawing their next victim and compelling them to drown themselves.  \n  \n Lloronas look much like they did in life, except they wear elegant funeral attire in undeath. Though stories typically describe lloronas as women, reports from seasoned adventurers include accounts of lloronas appearing as different genders and with a variety of appearances.",

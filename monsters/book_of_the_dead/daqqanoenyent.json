Though documentation is rare, such an manifestation can occur after a mass murder and the subsequent beheading of the corpses. Typically, this is done as a callous act of desecration, meant to deny the victims the possibility of being laid to rest with respect.  \n The daqqanoenyent consists of the combined tortured wills of the murdered victims. They will pursue the perpetrators and their associates without rest. This type of beheaded is both vengeful and easily distracted, however, making them a danger to anyone they happen across.",

The creature manifests as an enormous, disembodied head, 10 feet in height and covered in coarse black hair, with bat-like wings and vicious fangs and talons. Daqqanoenyents are naturally conflicted creatures. As the product of the tortured wills of numerous victims, daqqanoenyents sometimes exhibit strange or contradictory behavior as various individual wills struggle for control. Their conflicting desires make daqqanoenyents relatively easy to trick or deceive, and the creatures are vulnerable to fire. One story of a daqqanoenyent encounter describes the creature attempting to eat an old woman, only to be tricked by the woman into devouring a live coal. Their mouth aflame, the daqqanoenyent fled into the wilderness, never to be seen again.",

Iruxis often refer to these undead\u2014spirits bathed in starlight animating bone and rock, fueled by the beliefs of the living\u2014as \u201cthe twilight guardians.\u201d  \n  \n Iruxi ossatures usually reanimate spontaneously when a nesting chamber is violated or blood is spilled in an iruxi settlement's main hall. Truly ancient settlements might be blessed with a few ossatures' presence at all times: guarding nurseries, reliquaries, and the sacred observatories where their descendants study the heavens. These particularly hardy ossatures are composed of fossilized bone and possess dinosaur-like shield frills, horns, or spiked tails.",

I have gleaned that it involves rituals of fasting and a diet of certain poisonous nuts and teas used as preservatives. The monk must also be in a trance-like meditation at the moment of death. Physical movement and battle strain a dead body, and long stretches of inactivity might turn skin and bone brittle. Many Iroran mummies treat themselves by rubbing their skin with alchemical oils and wrapping their bodies in magically treated cotton or linen. Choosing a suitable resting spot as well as trying to maintain this resting place is equally important. Upon awakening, Iroran mummies often discover they've become a nesting place for birds or bats or acquired a thin layer of moss.",

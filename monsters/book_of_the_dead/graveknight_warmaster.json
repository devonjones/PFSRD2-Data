It loses any abilities that come from it being a living creature and any traits that represent its life, such as human and humanoid.  \n **Darkvision**  \n **Negative Healing**  \n **Rejuvenation** (divine, necromancy) When a graveknight is destroyed, its armor rebuilds its body over the course of 1d10 days\u2014or more quickly if the armor is worn by a living host (see Graveknight Armor, below). If the body is destroyed before then, the process restarts. A graveknight can only be permanently destroyed by obliterating its armor (such as with disintegrate), transporting it to the Positive Energy Plane, or throwing it into the heart of a volcano.  \n **Immunities** death effects, disease, paralyzed, poison, precision, unconscious, plus one energy type (the same chosen for ruinous weapons below).  \n **Sacrilegious Aura** (abjuration, aura, divine, evil) 30 feet. When a creature in the aura uses a positive spell or ability, the graveknight automatically attempts to counteract it, with the listed counteract modifier.  \n **Devastating Blast** [##] (arcane, evocation) The graveknight unleashes a 30-foot cone of energy. Creatures in the area take 1d12 damage, plus an additional 1d12 damage for every two levels the graveknight has (basic Reflex save). The graveknight can use this ability once every 1d4 rounds. This energy damage is of the same type as that of its ruinous weapons (see below); Devastating Blast gains the associated energy trait.  \n **Phantom Mount** [###] (arcane, conjuration, summon) The graveknight summons a supernatural mount as per *phantom steed*, heightened to a level equal to half the graveknight's level. Unlike *phantom steed*, the steed's AC and saving throw bonuses are all 4 lower than the graveknight's, and the steed has one-third the graveknight's Hit Points (rounded down). If the steed is destroyed, the graveknight must wait 1 hour before using this ability again.  \n **Ruinous Weapons** At the time of its creation, a graveknight chooses one of the following energy types that was relevant to its life or death: acid, cold, electricity, or fire. Any weapon the graveknight wields gains the effects of the *corrosive*, *frost*, *shock*, or *flaming* weapon rune, respectively, in addition to a *+1 striking* weapon rune. If the graveknight is 14th level or higher, its weapons instead gain the effects of the greater versions of both of these runes.  \n **Weapon Master** The graveknight has access to the critical specialization effects of any weapons it wields.",

It makes an Athletics check to Grapple using the graveknight's Athletics modifier \u2013 2. The armor can continue to Grapple the creature normally. Since the armor is grappling the creature, the graveknight doesn't need a free hand to do so.  \n**Eager for Battle** (fortune) When the graveknight rolls initiative, they roll twice and take the better result. They're quickened during their first round after rolling initiative and can use this extra action to Step, Stride, or Strike.  \n **Empty Save for Dust** The graveknight's armor contains nothing more than swirling dust that puffs out from joints in their armor. A living creature that touches or is touched by the graveknight (including one hit by the graveknight's fist Strike) must succeed at a Reflex saving throw or become contaminated with the dust. While contaminated, the targeted creature is stupefied 1 and gains weakness to the graveknight's energy damage equal to half the graveknight's level. The contamination ends after 1 minute or when the creature is doused with water, whichever occurs first.   \n**Graveknight's Shield** (arcane, necromancy) The graveknight's curse extends to their shield, or the graveknight's armor uses a portion of itself to produce a shield. The graveknight has a shield that uses the statistics of a *sturdy shield* of a level no higher than the graveknight's level \u2013 1. The shield is quasi-independent of the graveknight and automatically protects the graveknight from harm. When the shield is raised, it automatically uses Shield Block to reduce the damage of the first attack against the graveknight each round without the graveknight needing to spend their reaction to do so. The shield automatically rejuvenates with the rest of the graveknight and must be destroyed in the same manner as the graveknight's armor.  \n**Portentous Glare** (aura, divine, emotion, enchantment, fear, mental, visual) 30 feet. The graveknight's visage is one of overwhelming menace. When a creature ends its turn in the aura, it must attempt a Will saving throw. A creature that fails is doomed 1 (or doomed 1 and frightened 2 on a critical failure). The graveknight can activate or deactivate the aura by using an Interact action to open or close their helmet visor.",

They usually have reinforcements ready to deploy and redundant contingencies in place. Just as great strategists opine that an engagement is decided before the first blow is landed, a combat against a graveknight often feels like a desperate fight in a rapidly closing vise.",

The other Hellknights surrounded him and razed his castle, Citadel Gheisteno, to the ground. However, Shokneir's determination sustains his now-undead form, and he and his undead legions have rebuilt the citadel in all its haunting glory.  \n  \n **The Black Prince:** Although the graveknight known simply as the Black Prince was redeemed centuries ago as part of Iomedae's 11 Acts, it is said that the prince's armor remains intact\u2014and that vile forces conspire to reclaim it. If the armor is donned by one of the Black Prince's descendants, the Inner Sea will be beset by a terrible villain indeed.",

This agonizing transformation inevitably kills the host, transforming their flesh into the graveknight's new body. Removing the curse allows a character to remove the armor, but if it ever wears the armor again, the curse returns. If the wearer dies from another cause while wearing the armor, or if the graveknight's rejuvenation completes before the wearer dies from the curse, the wearer immediately progresses to stage 3.  \n **Graveknight's Curse** (arcane, curse, necromancy) This curse affects anyone who wears a graveknight's armor for at least 1 hour. **Saving Throw** Will save; **Onset** 1 hour; **Stage 1** doomed 1 and cannot remove the armor (1 day); **Stage 2** doomed 2, hampered 10, and cannot remove the armor (1 day); **Stage 3** dies and transforms into the armor's graveknight.",

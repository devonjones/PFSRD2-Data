The target takes 6d6 fire damage and is wreathed in ghostly flames for 1 minute, negating its concealed condition and rendering it concealed if it would be invisible.\n* **Crushing** (bludgeoning) The tormented was crushed or broken on the wheel. The target takes 4d8 bludgeoning damage and is knocked prone.\n* **Dislocation** (bludgeoning) The tormented had their limbs repeatedly broken or dislocated. For 1d4 rounds, the target is clumsy 2 and slowed 1.\n* **Drowning** (cold) The tormented was repeatedly drowned, held underwater and pulled back at the last instant. The target takes 4d6 cold damage and is sickened 2.\n* **Impalement** (piercing) The tormented was pierced with spears or blades and left to slowly die. The target takes 8d4 persistent bleed damage. (The creature doesn't take the persistent damage this turn, nor does it get its flat check to end the damage.)\n* **Starvation** (cold) The tormented starved to death, denied food until the end. For 1 minute, the target is enfeebled 2 and fatigued.",

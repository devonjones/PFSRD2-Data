Many such jiang-shi ministers rule over settlements or even entire city-states, cowing their subjects into unerring obedience.<br/><br/> A settlement or city-state under the control of a minister of tumult typically seems, on the outside, like everything is running smoothly and with clockwork precision. Guard patrols, street cleanings, carriages, and more always arrive precisely at the designated time, neither early nor late. To a visitor who doesn't pay any heed to the unease behind the smiles on the inhabitants' faces, the minister of tumult's fiefdom might appear to be a marvelous place to live. But the truth is much more dire. Ministers of tumult keep control and engorge themselves with qi by draining qi from criminals. If the minister of tumult is hungry and there haven't been any serious crimes, they simply dole out this punishment for petty crimes, minor infractions, or simple failures to perform adequately. This keeps the people in check, as there always seems to be a way to avoid the penalty by acting perfectly.<br/><br/><b><u><a aonid=\"563\" game-obj=\"Rules\">Recall Knowledge - Undead</a></u> (<u><a aonid=\"13\" game-obj=\"Skills\">Religion</a></u>)</b>: DC 32<br/><b><u><a aonid=\"563\" game-obj=\"Rules\">Unspecific Lore</a></u></b>: DC 30<br/><b><u><a aonid=\"563\" game-obj=\"Rules\">Specific Lore</a></u></b>: DC 27"

You might also need to adjust abilities that conflict with the jiang-shi's theme.

A jiang-shi can't perceive living creatures beyond 5 feet except with their breathsense. A living creature within the listed range who holds its breath is invisible to the jiang-shi for as long as it hold its breath. To hold its breath in this way, a creature must have one hand free to fully plug its nose or cover its mouth. (Refer to <a aonid=\"468\" game-obj=\"Rules\">Drowning and Suffocation</a> for the full rules on holding breath.) <br/><br/><b><a aonid=\"42\" game-obj=\"MonsterAbilities\">Negative Healing</a></b><br/><br/><b>Immunities</b><a aonid=\"40\" game-obj=\"Traits\">death</a> effects, <a aonid=\"46\" game-obj=\"Traits\">disease</a>, <a aonid=\"28\" game-obj=\"Conditions\">paralyzed</a>, <a aonid=\"126\" game-obj=\"Traits\">poison</a>, <a aonid=\"145\" game-obj=\"Traits\">sleep</a>, <a aonid=\"31\" game-obj=\"Conditions\">prone</a><br/><br/><b>One More Breath</b> (<a aonid=\"48\" game-obj=\"Traits\">divine</a>, <a aonid=\"117\" game-obj=\"Traits\">necromancy</a>, <a aonid=\"118\" game-obj=\"Traits\">negative</a>); Unlike other undead, a jiang-shi isn't destroyed at 0 HP. Instead, they fall <a aonid=\"38\" game-obj=\"Conditions\">unconscious</a> and awaken in 1 minute with 1 Hit Point. Scattering at least 1 Bulk of glutinous rice or hen eggs on an unconscious jiang-shi destroys them permanently. If the jiang-shi was reduced to 0 HP by an attack from a weapon made of <a aonid=\"273\" game-obj=\"Equipment\">darkwood</a>, they're destroyed immediately <br/><br/><b>Jiang-shi Vulnerabilities</b> All jiang-shi possess the following vulnerabilities.<ul> <li> <b>Revulsion</b> A jiang-shi can't voluntarily come within 10 feet of a brandished mirror or the sound of ringing handbells. A creature can Interact with a mirror or handbell to brandish or ring that item for 1 round (similar to <a aonid=\"98\" game-obj=\"Actions\">Raising a Shield</a>). If the jiang-shi involuntarily comes within 10 feet of an object of their revulsion, they gain the <a aonid=\"17\" game-obj=\"Conditions\">fleeing</a> condition, running from the object of their revulsion until they are 10 feet or farther from the object. After 1 round of being exposed to the object of their revulsion, a jiang-shi can attempt a DC 25 Will save as a single action, which has the <a aonid=\"32\" game-obj=\"Traits\">concentrate</a> trait. On a success, they overcome their revulsions for 1d6 rounds (or 1 hour on a critical success).</li> <li> <b>Bitter Epiphany</b> A jiang-shi is afflicted by severe melancholia when reminded of their debased nature and the truth of their existential disconnection from living beings. When a jiang-shi sees an altar with at least 1 Bulk of food offerings to ancestor spirits, they must attempt a DC 25 Will save. They are then temporarily immune to bitter epiphany for 1 minute.<br/> <b>Critical Success</b> The jiang-shi is unaffected.<br/> <b>Success</b> The jiang-shi is <a aonid=\"37\" game-obj=\"Conditions\">stupefied 1</a> for 1 round.<br/> <b>Failure</b> The jiang-shi is stupefied 2 for 1 minute.<br/> <b>Critical Failure</b> The jiang-shi is stupefied 2 and <a aonid=\"5\" game-obj=\"Conditions\">confused</a> for 1 minute. </li> </ul><b>Warped Fulu</b> The jiang-shi has corrupted the fulu attached to their brow. The jiang-shi is immune to spells cast from a magic item without expending a spell slot, such as from a scroll or wand. A creature can <a aonid=\"68\" game-obj=\"Actions\">Steal</a> a jiang-shi's fulu to remove it, rolling against the jiang-shi's Perception DC. This immediately ends the jiang-shi's immunity to these effects. If a creature then destroys a jiang-shi's removed fulu with an Interact action, the jiang-shi also loses their <a aonid=\"15\" game-obj=\"MonsterAbilities\">fast healing</a> ability. A jiang-shi can create a replacement fulu by spending 1 uninterrupted hour inscribing a strip of paper (or similar) with a writing instrument. <br/><br/><b>Rigor Mortis</b> The jiang-shi ignores difficult terrain and effects that would render it <a aonid=\"31\" game-obj=\"Conditions\">prone</a>. A jiang-shi can't take the <a aonid=\"78\" game-obj=\"Actions\">Drop Prone</a> action. When a jiang-shi <a aonid=\"81\" game-obj=\"Actions\">Leap</a>, it doesn't trigger reactions that are normally triggered by <a aonid=\"114\" game-obj=\"Traits\">move</a> actions, such as <a aonid=\"8\" game-obj=\"Actions\">Attacks of Opportunity</a>. <br/><br/><b>Claws</b> If the base creature had hands, its fingernails thicken and grow to terrible proportions, granting it an unarmed claw Strike that deals slashing damage, has the <a aonid=\"170\" game-obj=\"Traits\">agile</a> trait, and can <a aonid=\"18\" game-obj=\"MonsterAbilities\">Grab</a>. Use the moderate damage for the creature's level on the <a aonid=\"1018\" game-obj=\"Rules\">Strike Damage</a> table. <br/><br/><b>Drain Qi</b><span aria-label=\"Single Action\" class=\"action action-1\" role=\"img\" title=\"Single Action\"> </span>  (<a aonid=\"48\" game-obj=\"Traits\">divine</a>, <a aonid=\"117\" game-obj=\"Traits\">necromancy</a>) <b>Requirement</b> A <a aonid=\"20\" game-obj=\"Conditions\">grabbed</a>, <a aonid=\"28\" game-obj=\"Conditions\">paralyzed</a>, <a aonid=\"33\" game-obj=\"Conditions\">restrained</a>, <a aonid=\"38\" game-obj=\"Conditions\">unconscious</a>, or willing creature is within the jiang-shi's reach; <b>Effect</b> The jiang-shi drains the victim's life energy, or qi, through their breath. This requires an <a aonid=\"3\" game-obj=\"Skills\">Athletics</a> check against the  victim's Fortitude DC if the victim is grabbed and is automatic for any of the other conditions. The victim is <a aonid=\"10\" game-obj=\"Conditions\">drained 1</a> and the jiang-shi regains HP equal to 10% of its maximum HP, gaining any excess HP as temporary Hit Points. Draining qi from a creature that's already drained doesn't restore any HP to the jiang-shi but increases the victim's drained condition value by 1. If the victim has the ability to cast ki spells, it can spend 1 Focus Point to avoid becoming drained. This protects it only from the current attack, not from subsequent attempts to Drain Qi.<br/> A victim's drained condition value decreases by 1 every week. If the creature restricts their diet to glutinous rice for at least 1 day and spends 10 minutes dancing, jogging, or otherwise engaging in vigorous physical activity by succeeding at a DC 25 Athletics check, it reduces its drained condition by 1."

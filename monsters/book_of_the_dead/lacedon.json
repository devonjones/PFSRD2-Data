If the base creature has any abilities that come from it being a living creature, it loses them. It also loses any traits that represented its life as a living creature, such as human and humanoid. You might also need to adjust abilities that conflict with the theme of a ghoul. All ghouls gain the following abilities. The save DC for all abilities uses the DC of the ghoul's level.  \n **Darkvision**  \n **Negative Healing**  \n **Immunities** death effects, disease, paralyzed, poison, unconscious  \n **Claws** If the creature had hands, it gains a claw Strike (an agile unarmed attack that deals slashing damage plus paralysis). If it had any agile attacks, the damage dealt by its claws should be roughly the same as the damage dealt by those attacks. If it had only non-agile attacks, its claws should deal three-quarters that damage.  \n **Jaws** If the creature had a mouth, it gains a jaws Strike (an unarmed attack that deals slashing damage plus ghoul fever and paralysis). The damage amount should be the same as the creature's non-agile attacks.  \n **Consume Flesh** [#] (manipulate) **Requirements** The ghoul is adjacent to the corpse of a creature that died within the last hour. **Effect** The ghoul devours a chunk of the corpse and regains 1d6 Hit Points plus 1d6 for every 2 levels it has. It can regain Hit Points from any given corpse only once.  \n **Ghoul Fever** (disease) **Saving Throw** Fortitude; **Stage 1** carrier with no ill effect (1 day); **Stage 2** 2d6 negative damage and regains half as many Hit Points from all healing (1 day); **Stage 3** as stage 2 (1 day); **Stage 4** 2d6 negative damage and gains no benefit from healing (1 day); **Stage 5** as stage 4 (1 day); **Stage 6** dead, and rises as a ghoul the next midnight.  \n **Paralysis** (incapacitation, occult, necromancy) Any living, non-elf creature hit by a ghoul's attack must succeed at a Fortitude save or become paralyzed. It can attempt a new save at the end of each of its turns, and the DC cumulatively decreases by 1 on each such save.  \n **Swift Leap** [#] (move) The ghoul jumps up to half its Speed. This movement doesn't trigger reactions.",

First, increase the creature's level by 1 and change its statistics as follows. \n* Increase its AC, attack bonuses, DCs, saving throws, and skill modifiers by 1.\n* Increase its damage with Strikes and other offensive abilities by 1. If the creature is limited in how often it can use an ability (such as a breath weapon), increase the damage by 2 instead.",

In addition, the skeleton can move through any space that's large enough for its skull to fit through.<br/><br/><b>Frozen</b> The skeleton's bones are covered in a thin layer of ice. The skeleton gains immunity to cold and weakness 5 to fire and loses resistance to fire. The skeleton is surrounded by an aura of cold that deals cold damage equal to half the skeleton's level to all adjacent creatures at the start of the skeleton's turn (basic Reflex save with a standard DC for its level).<br/><br/><b>Grave Eruption</b><span aria-label=\"Two Actions\" class=\"action action-2\" role=\"img\" title=\"Two Actions\"> </span><b>Requirements</b> The skeleton is undetected and buried in dirt, gravel, or other loose material; <b>Effect</b> The skeleton erupts from the ground, Stands, and makes a melee Strike. The target is flat-footed against this Strike. If the Strike hits, the target is frightened 1 (or frightened 2 on a critical hit).<br/><br/><b>Lacquered</b> During the process to create the skeleton, it was covered with several layers of an alchemical lacquer, giving its bones a golden hue and granting added protection. The skeleton gains acid resistance 5 and a +2 status bonus to saves against effects that age or erode the target.<br/><br/><b>Nimble</b> The skeleton is particularly fast and nimble. Its land Speed increases by 10 feet and it has a climb Speed of 20 feet. In addition, it gains the Nimble Dodge reaction.<br/><br/><b>Rotten</b> The bones of this skeleton are black and rotten, having spent years in polluted water or some other foul substance. The skeleton loses its resistance to piercing and slashing damage and is surrounded by a horrific stench in a 10-foot aura. A creature entering or starting its turn in the aura must succeed at a Fortitude save against the standard DC of the skeleton's level or become sickened 1 (plus slowed 1 for as long as it remains sickened on a critical failure). While within the aura, affected creatures take a \u20132 circumstance penalty to saves against disease and to recover from the sickened condition. A creature that succeeds at its save is temporarily immune for 1 minute.<br/> This stench remains for 1 hour after the rotten skeleton has been destroyed unless the bones are burned, or the rot is washed away with at least 1 gallon of water.",

Geists fight to defend a haunt if they're within 100 feet of one, though they aren't compelled to remain. Small haunts might have no geists nearby, whereas large haunts can attract up to seven. Some instinctively flee the haunts that created them, while others are drawn to the source of their mortal demise by a force beyond their ability to understand.",

Created when a haunt kills an evil person, a geist rises from a soul trapped on the plane of their demise, now connected to the dark energy radiating from haunts everywhere. They wander the world, looking for solace and never finding it. In frustration, they turn their malice back onto the living, antagonizing any nearby creatures, hoping to fatally lure their victims into the clutches of a haunt to be turned into another geist and share the torment.  \n  \n Geists are occasionally mistaken for other incorporeal undead, such as wraiths and ghosts, but their proximity to haunts is one of the surest ways to determine the nature of the undead being encountered.",

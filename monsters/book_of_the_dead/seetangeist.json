Spells of cold and frost used to combat a red dragon in its volcanic lair can inadvertently wipe out entire colonies of algae and snails uniquely adapted to scorching environments. This occasionally gives rise to verdorite swarms that mindlessly grab and burn while being nearly indestructible thanks to their loosely cohesive \u201cbodies\u201d studded with iron-coated shells.",

There they gleefully concoct tonics and peddle cure-alls, charismatically convincing bystanders to overlook questionable ingredients and credentials. Ichor slingers feed on others' attention and trust, caring little for clients' health so long as buyers imbibe the offered medicines. Conversely, rejection infuriates ichor slingers. The undead often stalk, subdue, and administer unwanted medicines to those who snub them. When not selling \u201cpanaceas,\u201d ichor slingers harvest macabre ingredients to make dubious new medicines.",

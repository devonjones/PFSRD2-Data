This mask is quasi-corporeal, allowing it to be manipulated by both corporeal and incorporeal creatures. A creature who has the grappling spirit grabbed or restrained can remove the mask as an Interact action by succeeding at an Athletics check against the grappling spirit's Fortitude DC. Removing a grappling spirit's mask causes the spirit to fly into a frenzy. The grappling spirit becomes quickened and can use their extra action to Fly, Grapple, or Strike. They also gain a +4 status bonus to damage rolls, and they take a \u20134 status penalty to AC and Reflex saving throws. If the mask is put back on, the grappling spirit ends their frenzy.",

It also loses any traits that represented its life as a living creature, such as <a aonid=\"90\" game-obj=\"Traits\">human</a> and <a aonid=\"91\" game-obj=\"Traits\">humanoid</a>. You might also need to adjust abilities that conflict with the jiang-shi's theme. All jiang-shi gain the following abilities. <br/><br/><b><a aonid=\"12\" game-obj=\"MonsterAbilities\">Darkvision</a></b><br/><br/><b>Breathsense</b> 60 feet (<a aonid=\"411\" game-obj=\"Rules\">precise</a>). A jiang-shi can't perceive living creatures beyond 5 feet except with their breathsense. A living creature within the listed range who holds its breath is invisible to the jiang-shi for as long as it hold its breath. To hold its breath in this way, a creature must have one hand free to fully plug its nose or cover its mouth. (Refer to <a aonid=\"468\" game-obj=\"Rules\">Drowning and Suffocation</a> for the full rules on holding breath.) <br/><br/><b><a aonid=\"42\" game-obj=\"MonsterAbilities\">Negative Healing</a></b><br/><br/><b>Immunities</b><a aonid=\"40\" game-obj=\"Traits\">death</a> effects, <a aonid=\"46\" game-obj=\"Traits\">disease</a>, <a aonid=\"28\" game-obj=\"Conditions\">paralyzed</a>, <a aonid=\"126\" game-obj=\"Traits\">poison</a>, <a aonid=\"145\" game-obj=\"Traits\">sleep</a>, <a aonid=\"31\" game-obj=\"Conditions\">prone</a><br/><br/><b>One More Breath</b> (<a aonid=\"48\" game-obj=\"Traits\">divine</a>, <a aonid=\"117\" game-obj=\"Traits\">necromancy</a>, <a aonid=\"118\" game-obj=\"Traits\">negative</a>); Unlike other undead, a jiang-shi isn't destroyed at 0 HP. Instead, they fall <a aonid=\"38\" game-obj=\"Conditions\">unconscious</a> and awaken in 1 minute with 1 Hit Point. Scattering at least 1 Bulk of glutinous rice or hen eggs on an unconscious jiang-shi destroys them permanently. If the jiang-shi was reduced to 0 HP by an attack from a weapon made of <a aonid=\"273\" game-obj=\"Equipment\">darkwood</a>, they're destroyed immediately <br/><br/><b>Jiang-shi Vulnerabilities</b> All jiang-shi possess the following vulnerabilities.<ul> <li> <b>Revulsion</b> A jiang-shi can't voluntarily come within 10 feet of a brandished mirror or the sound of ringing handbells. A creature can Interact with a mirror or handbell to brandish or ring that item for 1 round (similar to <a aonid=\"98\" game-obj=\"Actions\">Raising a Shield</a>). If the jiang-shi involuntarily comes within 10 feet of an object of their revulsion, they gain the <a aonid=\"17\" game-obj=\"Conditions\">fleeing</a> condition, running from the object of their revulsion until they are 10 feet or farther from the object. After 1 round of being exposed to the object of their revulsion, a jiang-shi can attempt a DC 25 Will save as a single action, which has the <a aonid=\"32\" game-obj=\"Traits\">concentrate</a> trait. On a success, they overcome their revulsions for 1d6 rounds (or 1 hour on a critical success).</li> <li> <b>Bitter Epiphany</b> A jiang-shi is afflicted by severe melancholia when reminded of their debased nature and the truth of their existential disconnection from living beings. When a jiang-shi sees an altar with at least 1 Bulk of food offerings to ancestor spirits, they must attempt a DC 25 Will save. They are then temporarily immune to bitter epiphany for 1 minute.<br/> <b>Critical Success</b> The jiang-shi is unaffected.<br/> <b>Success</b> The jiang-shi is <a aonid=\"37\" game-obj=\"Conditions\">stupefied 1</a> for 1 round.<br/> <b>Failure</b> The jiang-shi is stupefied 2 for 1 minute.<br/> <b>Critical Failure</b> The jiang-shi is stupefied 2 and <a aonid=\"5\" game-obj=\"Conditions\">confused</a> for 1 minute. </li> </ul><b>Warped Fulu</b> The jiang-shi has corrupted the fulu attached to their brow. The jiang-shi is immune to spells cast from a magic item without expending a spell slot, such as from a scroll or wand. A creature can <a aonid=\"68\" game-obj=\"Actions\">Steal</a> a jiang-shi's fulu to remove it, rolling against the jiang-shi's Perception DC. This immediately ends the jiang-shi's immunity to these effects. If a creature then destroys a jiang-shi's removed fulu with an Interact action, the jiang-shi also loses their <a aonid=\"15\" game-obj=\"MonsterAbilities\">fast healing</a> ability. A jiang-shi can create a replacement fulu by spending 1 uninterrupted hour inscribing a strip of paper (or similar) with a writing instrument. <br/><br/><b>Rigor Mortis</b> The jiang-shi ignores difficult terrain and effects that would render it <a aonid=\"31\" game-obj=\"Conditions\">prone</a>. A jiang-shi can't take the <a aonid=\"78\" game-obj=\"Actions\">Drop Prone</a> action. When a jiang-shi <a aonid=\"81\" game-obj=\"Actions\">Leap</a>, it doesn't trigger reactions that are normally triggered by <a aonid=\"114\" game-obj=\"Traits\">move</a> actions, such as <a aonid=\"8\" game-obj=\"Actions\">Attacks of Opportunity</a>. <br/><br/><b>Claws</b> If the base creature had hands, its fingernails thicken and grow to terrible proportions, granting it an unarmed claw Strike that deals slashing damage, has the <a aonid=\"170\" game-obj=\"Traits\">agile</a> trait, and can <a aonid=\"18\" game-obj=\"MonsterAbilities\">Grab</a>. Use the moderate damage for the creature's level on the <a aonid=\"1018\" game-obj=\"Rules\">Strike Damage</a> table. <br/><br/><b>Drain Qi</b><span aria-label=\"Single Action\" class=\"action action-1\" role=\"img\" title=\"Single Action\"> </span>  (<a aonid=\"48\" game-obj=\"Traits\">divine</a>, <a aonid=\"117\" game-obj=\"Traits\">necromancy</a>) <b>Requirement</b> A <a aonid=\"20\" game-obj=\"Conditions\">grabbed</a>, <a aonid=\"28\" game-obj=\"Conditions\">paralyzed</a>, <a aonid=\"33\" game-obj=\"Conditions\">restrained</a>, <a aonid=\"38\" game-obj=\"Conditions\">unconscious</a>, or willing creature is within the jiang-shi's reach; <b>Effect</b> The jiang-shi drains the victim's life energy, or qi, through their breath. This requires an <a aonid=\"3\" game-obj=\"Skills\">Athletics</a> check against the  victim's Fortitude DC if the victim is grabbed and is automatic for any of the other conditions. The victim is <a aonid=\"10\" game-obj=\"Conditions\">drained 1</a> and the jiang-shi regains HP equal to 10% of its maximum HP, gaining any excess HP as temporary Hit Points. Draining qi from a creature that's already drained doesn't restore any HP to the jiang-shi but increases the victim's drained condition value by 1. If the victim has the ability to cast ki spells, it can spend 1 Focus Point to avoid becoming drained. This protects it only from the current attack, not from subsequent attempts to Drain Qi.<br/> A victim's drained condition value decreases by 1 every week. If the creature restricts their diet to glutinous rice for at least 1 day and spends 10 minutes dancing, jogging, or otherwise engaging in vigorous physical activity by succeeding at a DC 25 Athletics check, it reduces its drained condition by 1."

Although these rituals varied through the history of Ghol-Gan, each involved the sacrifice of numerous humanoids whose blood was used to write the runes scribed upon a gholdako's linens. Rarely, a cyclops initiated their own transformation into a gholdako, scribing runes glimpsed from oracular visions and fevered dreams on their clothes or carving them into their bare flesh. Regardless of their origin, gholdakos are guardians, bound beyond death to protect a location, relic, or person\u2014often the same thing they once defended in life.  \n  \n Despite their death and subsequent reanimation, gholdakos retain many of the quirks of living cyclopes, including their ceaseless hunger, volatile temper, single-mindedness, and great strength.",

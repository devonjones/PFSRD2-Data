Over his miserable existence, a little man in the woods seizes the possessions of those he kills, so the corpses retain nothing to link them to their past lives. He takes items he finds useful and abandons the rest, perhaps burying them in the earth, tossing them in water, or otherwise removing the items from the area around the corpses he hopes to curse. Thus, even if the corpses he tends are discovered, returning each one home for appropriate funerary rites is a challenging task.",

Denied the respect of a burial that would smooth his spirit's transition to the afterlife, he is unable to leave the mortal plane and enter the realm of the spirits. Forgotten, lost, and miserable, suffering from unbearable hunger and cold, the little man in the woods is desperate to return to his mortal home and be laid to rest properly.  \n  \n Despite his understandable motives, the little man in the woods has degenerated into a foul, twisted creature. He deceives travelers with plaintive cries then begs them to lead him to a home he barely recalls. He strangles all who can't or won't aid him, including those who lead him to the wrong home or otherwise delay his journey.  \n  \n The little man in the woods lays his victims' bodies out in the wilds, leaving the corpse unburied and exposed. He guards these rotting corpses over years as they shrivel and decay, until each one rises as another little man in the woods. Like any of the actions he has been compelled to perform, creating more of his kind brings the little man in the woods no pleasure.",

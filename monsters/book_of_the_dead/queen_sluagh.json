Sluagh collect the souls of those close to death and bring them to feed their queen.  \n  \n Most sluagh appear bald-headed, with rounded ears, sharp teeth, glossy black eyes, and scrawny bodies. Their rib cages show through their skin, which is translucent and soft as velvet.  \n  \n Sluagh can become ghostly and incorporeal for brief periods. They use this power to stalk their prey to great effect. Sometimes the glimpse of a sluagh is mistaken for a ghost sighting.",

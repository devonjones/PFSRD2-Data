Sluagh collect the souls of those close to death and bring them to feed their queen.  \n  \n Most sluagh appear bald-headed, with rounded ears, sharp teeth, glossy black eyes, and scrawny bodies. Their rib cages show through their skin, which is translucent and soft as velvet.  \n  \n Sluagh can become ghostly and incorporeal for brief periods. They use this power to stalk their prey to great effect. Sometimes the glimpse of a sluagh is mistaken for a ghost sighting.",

If the target is dead, it receives no save and the sluagh imprisons its soul in a small, grimy sack that keeps stolen souls fresh.  \n The sack is magically locked. Any sluagh can open it without difficulty, but any others must Pick the Lock (DC 35) or use *dispel magic* (5th level; counteract DC 32). A creature can Interact to empty an unlocked sack, which frees the souls but doesn't return them to life. While a soul is imprisoned, it can't be brought back to life by any means short of a *wish* or *miracle*. The sack can hold 12 souls at a time. Sluagh reapers typically attempt to return the souls to a queen so she can devour them."

Raw nerves \u201cborn\u201d in this way seem to appear and disappear at random intervals, like a flash of lightning during a storm. At the end of a powerful raw nerve's turns, roll 1d6. On a 1, 2, or 3, the raw nerve is visible, glowing with bright light that makes creatures dazzled while within 10 feet of it. On a 4, 5, or 6, it's invisible (as with a 4th-level *invisibility* spell).",

Necromantic energy takes hold of their brain and nervous system, causing these organs to burst forth from the charred flesh and become a raw nerve. These horrific undead float a few inches off the ground in a macabre arrangement morbidly parodying the creature's living form, with its brain at the top and nerves dangling below, crackling with electrical energy.  \n  \n A raw nerve can sense the thoughts of the living, perceiving them as a chaotic jumble that evokes an uncontrollable rage. The undead seeks to destroy the sources of these thoughts, which often means killing every living creature it can sense. Once a raw nerve detects no more thoughts, it grows still, floating in an almost meditative state. However, its fury instantly reawakens should a thinking creature pass too close. Though it's not mindless, a raw nerve can't be reasoned with, and the only way to stop one is to destroy it.",

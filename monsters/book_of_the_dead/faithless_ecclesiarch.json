If the weapon is simple, increase the damage die by one step; if it's two-handed, decrease the herexen's attack bonus with that weapon by 2.\n* Swap out the herexen's domain spell for a 1st-level focus spell from a domain associated with that deity.\n* Swap the defiled religious symbol for the correct deity. For example, an ex-Sarenite herexen carries a scimitar and a defiled religious symbol of Sarenrae, and can cast *fire ray* (attack +12) as a focus spell.",

There are dark tales of adventurers seeking refuge within a lone temple along the Wall of Heaven only to meet a terrible death at the hands of the temple's desecrated guardian. Although granting hospitality to strangers is a tenet of many Wall of Heaven temples, stories of monstrosities in disguise give some climbers pause as they approach a potential sanctuary.",

If the monster takes piercing or slashing damage equaling or exceeding the listed Rupture value from a single attack or spell, the engulfed creature cuts itself free. A creature that gets free by either Escaping or cutting itself free can immediately breathe and exits the swallowing monster\u2019s space.  \n  \n If the monster dies, a swallowed creature can be freed by creatures adjacent to the corpse if they spend a combined total of 3 actions cutting the monster open with a weapon or unarmed attack that deals piercing or slashing damage.",

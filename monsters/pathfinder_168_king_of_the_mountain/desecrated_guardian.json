The magic in some of these places lives on, corrupted by time, decay, and the nightmarish extraplanar powers of Leng often found at Golarion's highest altitudes. There are dark tales of adventurers seeking refuge within a lone temple along the Wall of Heaven only to meet a terrible death at the hands of the temple's desecrated guardian. Although granting hospitality to strangers is a tenet of many Wall of Heaven temples, stories of monstrosities in disguise give some climbers pause as they approach a potential sanctuary.",

Constructs are often mindless; they are immune to bleed damage, death effects, disease, healing, necromancy, nonlethal attacks, poison, and the doomed, drained, fatigued, paralyzed, sickened, and unconscious conditions; and they may have Hardness based on the materials used to construct their bodies. Constructs are not living creatures, nor are they undead. When reduced to 0 Hit Points, a construct creature is destroyed.",

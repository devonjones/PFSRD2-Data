The cloud doesn't move with the canopy elder and remains in place for 1d6 rounds before dissipating. Creatures inside the cloud become concealed, and all creatures outside the cloud become concealed to creatures within it. Non-plant and non-fungus creatures within the cloud must attempt a DC 38 Fortitude save. On a failure, the creature is sickened 3, and on a critical failure the creature is also blinded for 1 minute. Regardless of the result, a creature is then temporarily immune to the sickening and blinding effects of the canopy elder's pollen for 24 hours."

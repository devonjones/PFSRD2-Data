Tales say that bul-gae serve as faithful companions to the ancient, shadowy master of the first bul-gae. These tales purport that the shadow master can see through the distorted light of all bul-gae and uses the hounds as a means to watch the Material Plane for unknown purposes.",

Depending on whether they have most recently unleashed their lunar or solar powers, a bul-gae resembles either a crimson hound wreathed in flames or a cerulean, frostbitten fox, respectively.  \n  \n Legends say that the first bul-gae attempted to steal the sun from the sky. As they bit down on the burning sphere, though, the bul-gae was badly burned. Having failed, they then tried to retrieve the moon, but when they touched the moon the bul-gae froze solid and fell to the ground. The descendants of that bul-gae forever hone their powers of flame and ice so that they may one day succeed where their ancestor failed.",

This distorted light favors blue hues and skews the spectrum of visible colors, giving the world an eerie, muted ambiance. Tales say that bul-gae serve as faithful companions to the ancient, shadowy master of the first bul-gae. These tales purport that the shadow master can see through the distorted light of all bul-gae and uses the hounds as a means to watch the Material Plane for unknown purposes.",

They resemble large canines, though their coloration and features change as they exercise their powers over heat and cold. Depending on whether they have most recently unleashed their lunar or solar powers, a bul-gae resembles either a crimson hound wreathed in flames or a cerulean, frostbitten fox, respectively.  \n  \n Legends say that the first bul-gae attempted to steal the sun from the sky. As they bit down on the burning sphere, though, the bul-gae was badly burned. Having failed, they then tried to retrieve the moon, but when they touched the moon the bul-gae froze solid and fell to the ground. The descendants of that bul-gae forever hone their powers of flame and ice so that they may one day succeed where their ancestor failed.",

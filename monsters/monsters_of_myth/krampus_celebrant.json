            "text": "Fierce as he might be, Krampus rarely has the time to be everywhere at once. He doesn't have any particular ability to teleport or make speedy, long-distance travel, but he still strikes fear in the hearts of countless multitudes due to his power and the severity of the punishments he metes out.  \n  \n Due to this lack of ubiquity, most societies appreciate Krampus more as a folkloric bogeyman and less as a physical threat that they're likely to encounter during any particular year's solstice. Come winter festivals, adults delightfully dress up as Krampus, parading through the streets to carouse, spook youngsters, and wave birch switches around.  \n  \n However, if taken too far, this good-natured fun can attract Krampus's attention and blessing. Of course, this \u201cblessing\u201d is more of a dangerous curse that transforms those well-meaning revelers imitating him into sadistic tormentors dead-set on punishing the naughty before the festivities are through.  \n  \n These so-called Krampus celebrants maraud for several nights, executing ghoulish acts of terror, vandalism, and cruel justice upon those who have \u201cmisbehaved\u201d according to Krampus's own twisted sense of decorum, before reverting to their normal forms. Those who survive swiftly throw off their bloodstained pelts and costumes, swearing to never again tempt Krampus.  \n  \n The Krampus celebrant statistics below befit these revelers for a festival gone wrong, yet in a pinch, depending upon your campaign, they're also suitable for a much less powerful Krampus who could be vanquished by lower-level PCs or a manifestation or aspect of Krampus that appears to haunt villages that Krampus himself can't reach. It could even represent a community's shared belief and paranoia in Krampus manifesting in a creature of belief similar to a brainchild.",

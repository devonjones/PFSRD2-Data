Though quite similar to the descriptions of Desert's Howl, they seem to be individuals who haven't yet fully completed their transformation into the terrifying beast. Whether these unfortunate people met a cruel fate similar to that which spawned Desert's Howl or are spawn of the nightmarish creature itself is unclear. Some reports of encounters with these creatures note that it's possible to revert the creature back to its humanoid form by cleansing its mind of nightmarish visions, though there's no solid evidence of such an event ever occurring.",

            "text": "As discussed under Newborn Linnorms, female linnorms lay eggs in the wilderness, where linnorms are known to hunt. A linnorm egg remains viable for many years, protected by a tough, leathery skin easily mistaken for stone. When a male linnorm eventually stumbles across the egg, he fertilizes it and takes it to a secure and remote location, leaving it alone to eventually hatch. Newborn linnorms remain hidden in their nests for several months as they mature, growing large enough to hunt on their own and setting out into the world. These linnorms are roughly the equivalent of older teenagers when compared to other species. Younger linnorms, while still primal creatures with a strong tie to the First World, haven't yet manifested most of their magical powers. They still can't breathe deadly fire or lightning or see invisible creatures, and, most importantly, they can be slain without prompting the linnorm's legendary death curse. They do, however, have voracious appetites, consuming any living thing to fuel their rapid growth. A linnorm is most vulnerable during this time; scouts who find tracks of a young linnorm quickly muster a hunting party of stalwart and experienced warriors to track the creature down and kill it quickly\u2014before they draw the attention of the linnorm's father.",

The titanic crustacean wears the hulls of ruined ships as her shell, ripped into shape by vessel-rending claws, as nothing else in Golarion's oceans is large enough to shield her body\u2014or perhaps nothing else will satisfy her. Few ships can withstand her might, and fewer still are prepared for her appearance. Those who don't know of the thief of ships won't know to watch for her coming, and those who do know Tehialai offer her tribute to ward off her predation.",

            "text": "*Upon Receding Tide* notes several weapons Tehialai has refined in her predations on the ships of the Okaiyo Ocean. The least terrible ones are detailed below.  \n  \n **Barbed Spear** This long claw comes to a fine point, with barbs that can grip onto flesh and cloth alike.  \n **Melee** [#] barbed spear +27 (magical, reach 15 feet), **Damage** 4d8+12 piercing  \n **Release Claw** [#] Tehialai's spear shoots out, impaling prey and reeling them back. All creatures in a 40-foot line take 8d6 piercing damage (basic Reflex save); creatures that critically fail are grabbed until the end of Tehialai's next turn.  \n  \n **Boiling Club** The head of this short, blunt claw has a pattern not unlike a human face.  \n **Melee** [#] boiling club +25 (magical, reach 5 feet), **Damage** 4d12+12 bludgeoning plus 1d6 fire  \n **Release Claw** [#] (fire, sonic) The impact of Tehialai's claw begets a burning vacuum. Tehialai makes a boiling club Strike against one target within 15 feet. If she hits, a shock wave booms out, dealing 3d6 fire damage and 3d6 sonic damage to all creatures except her within 15 feet of the target, including the target itself (basic Fortitude save). If the Strike was a critical hit, the target uses the degree of success one lower than it rolled on its save. Unlike most fire abilities, this ability can be used underwater, and the typical 5 fire resistance for being underwater doesn't apply.  \n  \n **Salt Darts** A cluster of jagged salt crystals break off and regrow constantly as they draw salinity from the sea.  \n **Ranged** [#] salt dart +26 (magical, range 120 feet), **Damage** 2d8+12 piercing plus 2d8 acid  \n **Release Claw** [#] Tehialai launches a flurry of darts. She makes two salt dart Strikes against two different creatures. Both attacks count towards her multiple attack penalty, but she doesn't increase her penalty until after she has made both attacks.  \n  \n **Tidal Gourd** This spherical, transparent growth sprouts vesicles of frigid water that detach and fly like sling stones.  \n **Ranged** [#] tidal gourd +36 (magical, thrown 60 feet, water), **Damage** 2d8+4 bludgeoning plus 2d8 cold splash  \n **Release Claw** [#] (water) Tehialai atomizes the water in her claw to create a mist that fills a 40-foot emanation centered on her and that lasts until the end of her next turn or until dispersed by a strong wind. All creatures within the mist become concealed, and all creatures outside the mist become concealed to creatures within it. Wavesense functions through the mist and ignores the concealment.  \n  \n **Toothed Shredder** This chitinous disk bears numerous serrated protrusions, like a wheel of sharks' teeth.  \n **Melee** [#] toothed shredder +27 (fatal d10, magical, reach 15 feet), **Damage** 4d6+12 slashing  \n **Release Claw** [#] Tehialai's claw whirs and spins to cut through armor and ship hulls. Tehialai makes a toothed shredder Strike. On a hit, the target becomes flat-footed until the end of Tehialai's next turn and takes 2d12 persistent bleed damage.",

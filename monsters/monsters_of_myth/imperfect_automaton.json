            "text": "For every true automaton Ulistul has created since Jistka's fall, at least a dozen more were utter failures. Perhaps worse still are the near misses: *automaton cores* that captured only a fragment of the mortal's mind, resulting in physically powerful constructs with gaping holes in their memories, reasoning, or ethics. Haunted by the certainty that something isn't right, each of these constructs responds to its predicament in different ways. Those craving purpose often work with Ulistul or wander off in search of some other mentor, sometimes scavenging materials to rebuild themselves into some more complete, idealized version of what they were meant to be. Others spiral into the delusion that reality is an illusion, testing this hypothesis repeatedly through atrocities in a vain attempt to validate their own existences. A few simply lose faith in their own self-awareness, gradually acting more mindlessly until inspired back to lucidity by some extraordinary act or person.  \n  \n Ulistul periodically dispatches imperfect automatons as spies, couriers, or enforcers when she pursues simultaneous objectives. Encountering such constructs could be a community's first exposure to Ulistul's machinations, allowing heroes to trace automatons back to Ulistul's closest lab, uncover her broader schemes, or secure an audience to negotiate her aid. In addition to the imperfect automatons below, which represent the mechanical constructs that house damaged consciousnesses, Ulistul periodically recycles the now-lifeless bodies of the mortal donors into flesh golems. Little goes to waste in her quest for perfection.",

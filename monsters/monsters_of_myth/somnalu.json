Spiny frills run down the creature's mottled black back, interlaced with dull red stripes that streak from head to tail. Its two sets of forelimbs are bound to each other by small webs of skin. Its distinctive face lacks any visible mouth, nose, or ears, instead possessing only a huge red eye surrounded by six smaller, secondary eyes.",

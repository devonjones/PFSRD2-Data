The name Ulgrem-Axaan originally comes from the creature itself, and the rough approximation in Necril suggests that Ulgrem was its species with Axaan noting it as the last of its kind. Characters capable of cleansing Ulgrem-Axaan's eggs can watch the hatchlings grow into creatures resembling Ulgrem-Axaan, save that they lack any kind of undead touch. Upon seeing these young for the first time, if Ulgrem-Axaan is able to do so, it grants them the name \u201cUlgrem-Lurann.\u201d Through the same rough approximation, Ulgrem-Lurann means something akin to \u201cChildren of Ulgrem.\u201d",

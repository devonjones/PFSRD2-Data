What follows is a representative rendition of the Witch and her core abilities. In addition, this article includes three variations of the Mosquito Witch, each embodying one of her enduring mythologies by providing a handful of additional abilities. Add or remove these abilities to create the Shimmerford cryptid of your imagination, and remember that the spookiest legends are often the ones the PCs barely encounter directly.",

The witch offers an answer to the dreamer's deepest question, and if the dreamer accepts, the witch drinks their blood as they sleep, tastes their options, and leaves an answer nearby, written with some of the stolen fluids. This Mosquito Witch isn't necessarily malicious, but neither does she worry about draining too much or painting embarrassing blood-truths for all of Shimmerford to see. The blood's weight makes her footfalls heavy, and hunters often remark that especially deep tracks left by anyone are \u201cheavy with answers\u201d in homage to the Witch.  \n  \n The Hemoprophet variant gains the following abilities.  \n  \n **Bloodbelly** The Mosquito Witch steals and stores stolen blood to power her divinations. Whenever she deals piercing damage, the Mosquito Witch can gain an equal number of Blood Points, to a maximum of 100 Blood Points. She becomes clumsy 1 so long as she has at least 40 Blood Points stored, or clumsy 2 if she has at least 80 Blood Points stored. **Slurp** [@] **Trigger** A creature adjacent to the Mosquito Witch takes persistent bleed damage; **Effect** The Mosquito Witch slurps up some of the creature's blood and gains Blood Points equal to the bleed damage dealt.  \n  \n **Occult Innate Spells** DC 29; **7th** *retrocognition* (\u00d73); **6th** *object reading* (\u00d73), *scrying* (\u00d73); **5th** *locate* (\u00d73), *prying eye* (\u00d73); **4th** *read omens* (\u00d73); **3rd** *wanderer's guide* (\u00d73)  \n  \n **Prophecy in Red** The Mosquito Witch can't Cast an occult Spell without simultaneously expending a number of Blood Points equal to 10 \u00d7 the spell's level.",

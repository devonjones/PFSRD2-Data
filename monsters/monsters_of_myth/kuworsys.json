            "text": "At a distance, the creature known as Kuworsys might be mistaken for a crawling undead hand, possessed of two thumbs instead of one. These \u201cthumbs\u201d are actually the being's hind limbs, which it can clumsily stand upon should it choose. Each of its fingerlike limbs bears a smaller hand on the end, giving Kuworsys an eerie gait possessed of too many moving joints. Wedged within the wrist-shaped tissue that makes up the creature's head are three bloodshot eyes, glaring balefully from lids twisted into shape from ropes of flesh.  \n  \n Whether part of its base nature or due to its long imprisonment, Kuworsys appears to be skinned and rotting, its body riddled with ragged holes held together by raw sinew. Despite its glistening and putrid appearance, it isn't undead, nor does it leave any trace of blood or gristle in its wake. Those who believe its condition might slow it down are often shocked by the creature's jittering speed, and those who believe they might be able to track it by the scent of rotting flesh find themselves inhaling the beast's deadly, exhausting spores instead.  \n  \n When encountering another creature, Kuworsys doesn't approach initially, instead observing the stranger while hidden or at a distance. While it might grow bolder and approach to examine or provoke another being, it prefers to avoid direct confrontation and is intelligent and stealthy enough to deftly avoid discovery. Its presence proves deadly enough, even without any further aggression, as those who Kuworsys stalks eventually succumb to a lethal lethargy.",

However, rumors abound that it grows more aggressive when it has finished its observations. In battle, Kuworsys might unleash all the pent-up wrath of a creature trapped in a labyrinth for centuries. In that case, replace one or more of its abilities, especially observational abilities such as Gauge Potential, with one or more of the following abilities on a one-for-one basis.  \n  \n **Careless Block** [@] **Trigger** A creature attempts a Strike against Kuworsys; **Effect** Kuworsys blocks the triggering Strike by snapping its sling or a stolen weapon into a blocking position. Damage is dealt to Kuworsys's weapon first. If the weapon would be destroyed, excess damage is dealt to Kuworsys.  \n  \n **Rain Blows** [###] **Requirements** Kuworsys is Reared Back; **Effect** Kuworsys Strikes each creature within its reach, to a maximum of four Strikes (one for each available limb). It can make limb Strikes or weapon Strikes, including with ranged weapons, but can use each weapon only once. Each attack counts toward Kuworsys's multiple attack penalty, but the multiple attack penalty doesn't increase until after it makes all the attacks.  \n  \n **Rapid Bombardment** Kuworsys's sling becomes a reload 0 weapon instead of reload 1.  \n  \n **Smash and Grab** [###] Kuworsys Strides up to twice its Speed. At the end of its movement, it can make a melee limb Strike. On a successful Strike, the creature becomes grabbed until the end of Kuworsys's next turn.",

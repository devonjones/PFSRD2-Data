When a spore thrall is slain, its soul finally travels to the Boneyard for judgment, but the fungus-encrusted physical remains often spawn new fungal creatures, such as myceloids, violet fungi, or drakauthixes. These fungal spawn are not controlled by the fungus tyrant but generally regard them as an ally or, more often, a divinity.",

            "text": "Hundreds of years ago, a cadre of powerful succubus assassins invaded the Abyssal realm of the demon lord of disease and fungus, Cyth-V'sug. These succubi sought to slay a powerful witch who had befouled a profane temple the assassins served. The succubi failed at their mission, but from their corpses grew the first fungus tyrants. Pleased with this development, the witch then seeded numerous worlds on the Material Plane with fungus tyrant spores, who have since grown and thrived in their new environments as rot thrives in a corpse. Today, hundreds of fungus tyrants inhabit the fouler locales of the Material Plane. They're particularly fond of large cave systems and ruined cities, but also can be found in corrupted woodlands where blighted fey rule or in the sewers of active cities that spew vast amounts of magical waste.  \n An encounter with a normally unintelligent plant monster acting with methodical intent can be evidence of a fungus tyrant's manipulations, but fungus tyrants are equally fond of keeping other types of creatures as pets and thralls\u2014particularly attractive humanoids. Especially favored minions are given the gift of the fungus tyrant's embrace and are transformed into fungoid minions forever loyal to their pallid ruler. Yet most fungus tyrants realize that a diverse array of guardians is best, and they often choose to keep some non-fungus minions on hand to protect their lair.  \n Fungus tyrants are violently jealous. Any who attempt to lure away their dominated pets or cure those who have been infected by them earns their eternal ire. Yet it's succubi who enrage fungus tyrants the most. In these demons, the fungus tyrant sees a former glamour and power they no longer have access to, and only the brutal destruction of these mocking memories can salve a fungus tyrant's anger. A fungus tyrant faced with someone whom they suspect might be a succubus is terrible indeed, for in such battles, the fiendish fungal beings abandon their normal approach of subtle mental trickery and bring all of their power to bear in an attempt to rip the offending creature apart. Fungus tyrants also take great delight in transforming succubi into fungoid creatures under their control.   \nWhile their jealousy doesn't compel them to do battle with other fungus tyrants, they're always careful to maintain their own territories apart from any nearby kin, and they take great pains not to \u201cpoach\u201d other tyrant's charmed and infested pets.  \nA fungus tyrant is 6 feet tall and weighs 150 pounds.",

After this time, the creature is restored to life but gains the fungus trait and becomes a spore thrall. This prevents the creature's soul from continuing on to the afterlife in a similar manner to how undead are taken out of that cycle\u2014as such, those who hold that cycle sacred (particularly worshipers of Pharasma) regard spore thralls as bad as the undead, despite them being living creatures. If the new spore thrall is a lower level than its creator, then it's under the creator's control. If a fungus tyrant controls too many spore thralls at once (as determined by the GM), strong-willed spore thralls can free themselves by succeeding at a DC 28 Will save. Typically, a fungus tyrant avoids creating spore thralls out of fallen foes who are too powerful to control, for they're only too aware of the compulsion for revenge such victims might harbor for those who wrenched them from the afterlife."

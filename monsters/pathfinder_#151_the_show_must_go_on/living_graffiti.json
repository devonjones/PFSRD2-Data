They cannot exist apart from the surfaces they traverse except in brief bursts, which they typically use to harass or attack nearby creatures. Although they are not incredibly intelligent, living graffiti exhibit a mischievous spitefulness and seeming desire to make the real world as much of a caricature as their own two-dimensional domain.

Bone croupiers take the meaning of \u201clife-consuming\u201d to its literal extreme. Undead gamblers whose lust for cards and dice couldn\u2019t be sated in life, they haunt the shadowy corners of gambling halls and continue their search for that next hit of adrenaline.<br/><br/>In undeath, gaming takes on a different flavor; with nothing left to lose, bone croupiers turn their attentions toward others, cajoling and palavering normally casual gamers into committing themselves to ever higher stakes. Before they know it, these unsuspecting victims have called in decades-old favors and put liens on their homes in the hope of winning back just a fraction of the pot. But by then the bone croupier has already claimed its prize\u2014for to this undead chiseler, any earnings are incidental, and the real prize is encouraging others to lose their own.<br/><br/> Bone croupiers often enshroud themselves in thick layers of cigar smoke or voluminous robes to mask their undead nature, but they almost always wear wicked grins at the table. This smile is no ruse or part of its poker face, however\u2014the truth is that bone croupiers truly delight in games, regardless of whether they are winning or losing, and despite their incredible skills of deception and trickery, most simply can\u2019t disguise their unbridled mirth.\n<br/><br/><b><u><a aonid=\"5\" game-obj=\"Skills\" general=\"true\">Recall Knowledge - Undead</a></u> (<u><a aonid=\"13\" game-obj=\"Skills\">Religion</a></u>)</b>: DC 20",

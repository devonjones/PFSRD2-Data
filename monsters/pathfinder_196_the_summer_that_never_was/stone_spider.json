They function at all times as if Inhabiting their Vessel and they are unable to cease Inhabiting their Vessel. If Ugly Cute is destroyed in the mindscape, they remain destroyed and can't reconstitute, although if the mindscape were to reset, Ugly Cute would return to life as well, once more fully Inhabiting their Vessel.",

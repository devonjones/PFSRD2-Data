A force for entropy and the breaking of cycles, nindorus are hideous creatures whose bodies often appear distorted, who wield weapons that have been shattered yet still function, and whose true face is often hidden from view. They display traits one might expect to see in an undead creature, such as decaying flesh or exposed bones, yet a nindoru is very much still alive.  \n  \n Each nindoru epitomizes the fracture of a specific cycle, be it one from the natural world or from societal traditions. To the nindoru, nothing is more delicious than the consumption of a creature who has reincarnated multiple times, with those who are theoretically about to ascend to true enlightenment presenting the tastiest meal. Those slain by a nindoru are themselves torn from the cycle\u2014the lucky ones move on to the Boneyard for judgment, but many are instead corrupted to form more of these horrific fiends.  \n  \n Followers of Sangpotshi find nindoru to be particularly abhorrent and count them among the greatest threats imaginable. Most commonly found in regions of the world where the reincarnation cycle is strongest, nindorus are, like rakshasas and oni, associated most strongly with the Material Plane.",

If the akashti can consume a portion of the body it's duplicating, it gains a +4 circumstance bonus to Deception checks to Impersonate the creature. While wearing a manifested body, the akashti loses its claw Strike, and its voice sounds like that of the dead creature; it doesn't possess any of the dead creature's memories or skills and must rely on deception to continue the charade in the face of scrutiny. An akashti's manifested body decays swiftly if it doesn't take 10 minutes once per day to maintain the manifestation of the false flesh. The body has 10 Hit Points and the same defenses as the akashti. When the body is destroyed, the akashti emerges unharmed and the fleshy shell left behind scatters into a cloud of red butterflies that swiftly fade into red mist."

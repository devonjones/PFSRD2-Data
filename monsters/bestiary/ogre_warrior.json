But for all their creativity in developing methods of violence, ogres often remain too dim-witted to realize that their playthings lack an ogre\u2019s robust fortitude and high pain tolerance, so most captives die far sooner than the ogres might prefer. Such a fate is perhaps preferable however, as those who survive too long as ogres\u2019 playthings suffer lasting mental scars from the horrifying abuse. A captive able to keep their wits can sometimes trick the brutes by promising treasure, meatier captives, or other crude amusements, taking advantage of an ogre\u2019s limited intellect to engineer opportunities to escape.<br/><br/> Ogres are social creatures only in the most debased sense. They gather together in groups called families, though members are not always related by blood. Ogres practice incest regularly, believing that it makes for stronger familial bonds, and most ogres are misshapen or mutated from generations of inbreeding. The most powerful ogre in any family is the \u201cboss\u201d\u2014usually the family\u2019s patriarch or matriarch\u2014while other ogres in the family learn to obey or risk being brutalized by the boss\u2019s loyal kin. Ogres lair in caves, crumbling ruins, or dilapidated shacks close enough to humanoid settlements or animal trails to make raiding easy. These lairs are filthy and frequently contain all-too-recognizable evidence of their depravity.",

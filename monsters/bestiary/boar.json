Boars are most likely to attack humanoids either in self-defense or during their mating season in the winter months, when the males grow an extra inch of tissue to protect their organs as they fight off rivals. Of course, in some cultures boars are trained to become much more aggressive so they can fill the roles of warbeast and guardian. When such boars escape back into the wild, they can become true terrors of the region.",

Boars breed freely, and a pair of boars can rapidly grow to a large family. Boars are a particular nuisance to farmers, as they break into food stores and root through gardens to sate their hunger.",

            "text": "Frost giants are remorseless marauders who pillage and plunder from those who dare to live near them in desolate, frigid lands. Their clans range from extremely territorial hunters who claim an expanse of tundra and defend it at all costs to nomadic hordes that roam icy slopes in search of settlements to conquer. Frost giant clans are ruled by those who exhibit the greatest ferocity and prowess in battle\u2014massive brutes who proclaim themselves jarl and demand absolute obedience from their followers. If at any time a frost giant wishes to be a jarl, all they must do is issue a challenge to the current jarl and face off in mortal combat, after which the reigning champion continues leading the clan or the victorious challenger assumes control.  \n  \n Frost giants live in frostbitten realms, and their appearance is reflective of a people weathered and hardened by relentless snowstorms and freezing temperatures. They often wear metal armor adorned with the furs, skin, teeth, and tusks of slain beasts and heft weapons as long as dining tables. Their flesh ranges from pale blue to shale gray, and their hair is typically a dingy white or dirty yellow color.  \n  \n A typical frost giant stands about 15 feet tall and weighs approximately 2,800 pounds.",

If you wish to try, it\u2019s best to make sure you know your players well and have their trust. You can take a targeted player aside to let them know that, for a time, they\u2019ll be playing a doppelganger, but take care not to remove the player\u2019s agency from the game for too long or too often, as that can get old fast from the other side of the GM screen!",

            "text": "In their natural forms, doppelgangers are humanoid creatures with flesh of indeterminate color and features that lack fine details, as if unfinished. As masters of mimicry, they use their abilities to impersonate others in devious ways, often infiltrating settlements and residing within them for years without being detected.  \n  \n Doppelgangers are incredibly secretive, with some nearing outright paranoia. They choose their targets carefully and go to great lengths not to reveal their intentions before their plans come to fruition. Doppelgangers usually infiltrate communities in order to gain some manner of wealth or power, and assume the guises of other (usually influential) persons to allow the creatures they\u2019re impersonating to take the fall for any negative consequences that may result from their actions.  \n  \n Though most are not evil, doppelgangers are manipulative and self-serving. As they don\u2019t have their own society and aren\u2019t monolithic in their motivations, an individual doppelganger has its own unique interests and impulses, though many are over-indulgent. Some doppelgangers enjoy the thrill of subtlety, while others favor grander schemes, such as manipulating a nation\u2019s political infrastructure. Others seek to exploit merchant guilds to gain immense wealth, while others use their shape-changing ability to destroy relationships between close friends or families.  \n  \n Doppelgangers are careful and patient creatures. They are willing to slowly construct elaborate schemes that may require extended periods of time\u2014even decades\u2014to yield results.  \n  \n Doppelgangers often work alone, as they don\u2019t trust potential cohorts not to ruin their plans. There are rare times when doppelgangers might reveal secrets to high-ranking individuals to ensure a successful infiltration. When they do work with others, it\u2019s because they\u2019ve taken the shape of a target group\u2019s leader, unbeknownst to the organization\u2019s members.  \n  \n Doppelgangers can grow in power by learning skills and abilities, and often make excellent rogues, spellcasters, or fighters. A doppelganger that has class abilities can often effectively infiltrate and plague an adventuring group as a powerful antagonist\u2014but using a doppelganger like this in your game should be handled with care (see the Infiltrating a Party sidebar above for more information).",

If it comes under the effect of a second polymorph effect, the second polymorph effect attempts to counteract the first. If it succeeds, it takes effect, and if it fails, the spell has no effect on that target. Any Strikes specifically granted by a polymorph effect are magical. Unless otherwise stated, polymorph spells don't allow the target to take on the appearance of a specific individual creature, but rather just a generic creature of a general type or ancestry.  \n  \n If you take on a battle form with a polymorph spell, the special statistics can be adjusted only by circumstance bonuses, status bonuses, and penalties. Unless otherwise noted, the battle form prevents you from casting spells, speaking, and using most manipulate actions that require hands. (If there's doubt about whether you can use an action, the GM decides.) Your gear is absorbed into you; the constant abilities of your gear still function, but you can't activate any items.",

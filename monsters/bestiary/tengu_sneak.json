Known as \u201cjinx eaters,\u201d these tengu are treated as mascots by their pirate crews. Jinx eaters don\u2019t mind this treatment, however, since it allows them to escape much of the drudgery associated with working on a ship. When a tengu is sailing with pirates afraid of ill fortune, the claim that \u201chunger leads to bad luck\u201d secures comfort and respect for the jinx eater more effectively than any bribe.",

            "text": "Crow-like humanoids, tengus are a canny and clever people who can be found across all of Golarion. Tengus are used to being minorities and facing suspicion wherever they travel, so by necessity many possess a knack for languages as well as for blades. They live on the fringes of society and tend to flock toward less-than-legal occupations, earning them their reputation for being streetwise and unscrupulous\u2014a label that, in turn, perpetuates the tengus\u2019 oppressive cycle of discrimination and illegitimate work.<br/><br/> Although humanoid, tengus have very distinct, birdlike features, and many would say that they resemble crows more than they do humans. They have strong, thick beaks, as well as sharp talons at the ends of their arms and legs. Most of a tengu\u2019s body is covered in small feathers that range in color from dark brown and midnight blue to glossy black, with lighter colors being rare but not unheard of. Like many avian creatures, tengus have hollow bones, making them much lighter than other humanoids of their size, although few tengus possess the wings necessary to fly naturally. A tengu\u2019s speech might be punctuated by quick clucks or throaty cawing, and many tengus practice conversation diligently to rid themselves of these involuntary ticks. Ruf  ing of the feathers and compulsive, jerky movements of the neck are other trademark habits. Tengus reproduce by laying eggs: the average tengu egg is about 11 inches in diameter and 16 inches tall and takes 4 months to hatch.<br/><br/> Tengus are a people in diaspora and are almost always found within larger kingdoms and communities of other races. Perhaps because they are more visually distinctive than most other humanoid races, tengus tend to be distrusted and persecuted more often than, for example, elves or dwarves. As a result, tengus tend to gather in close-knit social groups composed of other outcasts and people of uncommon ancestry. Few true tengu communities exist, and those that do are often exiled to ghettos and other forgotten city quarters. From an early age, tengus learn that the world is not a friendly place and that they must look out for themselves.<br/><br/><b><u><a aonid=\"5\" game-obj=\"Skills\" general=\"true\">Recall Knowledge - Humanoid</a></u> (<u><a aonid=\"14\" game-obj=\"Skills\">Society</a></u>)</b>: DC 16",

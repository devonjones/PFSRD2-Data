They command the unwavering reverence of all other metallic dragons, who view gold dragons as their leaders and counselors. Golds rival the raw power of even red dragons, much to the chagrin of their chromatic cousins, and the two races are often regarded as bitter rivals. But despite their incredible power, gold dragons are fond of discourse and prefer to talk through solutions to problems rather than rely upon brute strength. Long-lived as they are, they necessarily take a wide view of all situations and never act without considering all possible options and outcomes. Because of this, gold dragons willingly converse with any creature that seeks them out, even evil chromatic dragons. Mortals might find this behavior strange, considering the longstanding war between chromatic and metallic dragons, but dragons know all too well that desperate situations sometimes call for drastic alliances. And although gold dragons might consider brief truces with their chromatic brethren in the case of world-ending threats, they also know when such alliances have run their course.<br/><br/> When another metallic dragon faces a quandary or a foe beyond its own ability to overcome, its best option is often to seek the counsel of the eternally wise and gloriously righteous gold dragons. Locating these legendary beings is no easy task, however, for gold dragons are notoriously reclusive. Their intellect and wisdom is such that they prefer to ponder the great questions of life in seclusion, where they strive to formulate solutions to the world's most pressing problems. As a result, gold dragons are sometimes absent when metallic dragons gather together, or are missing from tribunals where their counsel would be beneficial. Impatient dragons sometimes begrudge gold dragons for this apparent unreliability, but such aspersions are usually a result of jealousy rather than any true criticism; in their hearts, other dragons know that few gold dragons purposefully exclude themselves from truly important matters.<br/><br/> A gold dragon's incredible foresight and unparalleled enlightenment means they are unlikely to interfere in the business of individual mortals, though the rare person who captures the attention of a gold dragon is fortunate indeed, for there are few beings in the cosmos who can offer such prudent and considerate advice. Rulers and individuals in stations of high power have an easier time of garnering the aid of a gold dragon; entire wars have been avoided thanks to a gold dragon's last-minute intermediation.<br/><br/> Gold dragons are often found in warm grasslands and savannas, lands where they can enjoy long, meditative flights without attracting the attention of potential enemies. They tend to sleep either out in the open in a barren, remote place, or within a heavily secreted or fortified lair, such as a forgotten sink hole or in the labyrinthine caverns of a terrestrial chasm. Gold dragons may enlist trusted servants and allies to guard their lairs, though many live truly solitary lives, preferring to protect their hoards with nonlethal traps and magical wards.<br/><br/><b><u><a aonid=\"5\" game-obj=\"Skills\" general=\"true\">Recall Knowledge - Dragon</a></u> (<u><a aonid=\"2\" game-obj=\"Skills\">Arcana</a></u>)</b>: DC 28"

Few have ever seen a metallic dragon firsthand, but tales of their intervention in mortals\u2019 lives\u2014and of their passing\u2014always spread far and wide. Named for the way their scales resemble the shining metals humanoids use in commerce, warfare, and industry, these immense beings are diverse in their interests and abilities, and they don\u2019t seem to mind being associated with such mundane materials. After all, to compare a gold dragon to a gold coin is like comparing an ocean to a glass of water\u2014though they may seem similar at first glance, the raw power, breadth, and grandeur of one simply overwhelms the other.<br/><br/> In addition to metallic dragons and their chromatic counterparts (page 104\u2013115), other types of dragons roam the world and the rest of the multiverse. In the legendary lands of Tian Xia on the other side of the globe are the imperial dragons, serpentine beings who protect the cosmic balance and defend their ancient homeland. Outside the Material Plane, primal dragons such as the domineering brine dragon and reclusive cloud dragon shape the nature and goings-on of the Elemental Planes. Countless other types of dragons are sure to exist, including dragons on far-fiung planes of existence and, it is rumored, primeval dragons who soar between the stars. "

Bronze dragons are abundant in Taldor, and many copper dragons lair in the wilds of Andoran, where they wage war alongside other freedom fighters to overthrow devils in the neighboring empire of Cheliax.

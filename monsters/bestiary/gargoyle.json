These water-dwelling gargoyles often dwell in shallow coastal regions and shamble forth from the sea to attack prey. Kapoacinths are less individualistic and tend to create more stable wings for longer periods of time. Kapoacinths have the same abilities as the gargoyle presented below, but with the following adjustments: they have the aquatic trait, they have a swim Speed of 40 feet instead of a fly Speed, and their Clawed Feat reaction triggers when they are Swimming instead of Flying.  \n  \n***Recall Knowledge - Beast* (*Arcana*, *Nature*)**: DC 19  \n***Unspecific Lore***: DC 17  \n***Specific Lore***: DC 14",

They use their resemblance to decorative statues to hide in plain sight in cities during the day and descend upon unlucky pedestrians at night. Their most common form is that of a horned humanoid with bat-like wings, but individual gargoyles show a great deal of variation, with some appearing more or less humanoid and others resembling no known creature. A gargoyle\u2019s features are not flxed; city-dwelling gargoyles who remain in the same locale long enough slowly morph, day by day, to match the style of the local architecture. These patient monsters can stay disguised for long stretches of time as they patiently await an opportunity to strike.  \n  \n Gargoyles tend to be lone hunters, though sometimes they band into fearsome tribes called \u201cwings\u201d for protection or sport. On rare occasions, wings become relatively stable communities, and gargoyles in wings may even ally with other creatures such as demons and intelligent aberrations, though these alliances exist on a razor\u2019s edge. The majority of gargoyles are treacherous, vindictive, and petty\u2014traits that preclude lasting partnerships. Many tend to be obsessive and compulsive. Some are collectors, focusing on anything from books to grim trophies, while others are ritualistic or overly passionate about niche intellectual subjects or certain artistic motifs. These tendencies often contribute to the dissolution of wings as individuals\u2019 obsessions and compulsions clash.",

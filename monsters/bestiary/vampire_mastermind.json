It also loses any traits that represented its life as a living creature, such as human and humanoid. You might also need to adjust abilities that conflict with the vampire\u2019s theme.<br/><b>Negative Healing</b><br/><b>Immunities</b> death effects, disease, paralyze, poison, sleep<br/><b>Coffin Restoration</b> (<a aonid=\"48\" game-obj=\"Traits\">divine</a>, <a aonid=\"117\" game-obj=\"Traits\">necromancy</a>, <a aonid=\"118\" game-obj=\"Traits\">negative</a>) Unlike other undead, a vampire isn\u2019t destroyed at 0 HP. Instead, it falls unconscious. If its body rests in its coffin for 1 hour, the vampire gains 1 HP, after which its fast healing begins to function normally.<br/><b>Vampire Weaknesses</b> All vampires possess the following weaknesses.<ul><li><b>Compulsions</b> Vampires are creatures of strange and unknowable compulsions. A typical vampire can\u2019t voluntarily cross running water unless it is transported while it hides within its con, nor can it enter a private dwelling unless invited in by someone with the authority to do so. At your discretion, vampires might have different compulsions\u2014a pirate vampire might not be able to set foot on solid ground without being invited, for example. The vampire can still be forced to do these things and might be able to overcome its compulsion just as it does its revulsion (see below).</li> <li><b>Revulsion</b> A vampire can\u2019t voluntarily come within 10 feet of brandished garlic or a brandished religious symbol of a non-evil deity. To brandish garlic or a religious symbol, a creature must Interact to do so for 1 round (similar to Raising a Shield). If the vampire involuntarily comes within 10 feet of an object of its revulsion, it gains the fleeing condition, running from the object of its revulsion until it ends an action beyond 10 feet. After 1 round of being exposed to the subject of its revulsion, a vampire can attempt a DC 25 Will save as a single action, which has the concentrate trait. On a success, it overcomes its revulsions for 1d6 rounds (or 1 hour on a critical success).</li> <li><b>Stake</b> A wooden stake driven through a vampire\u2019s heart drops the vampire to 0 HP and prevents it from healing above 0 HP, even in its coffin. Staking a vampire requires three actions and works only if the vampire is unconscious. If the stake is removed, the vampire can heal above 0 HP again, and if it\u2019s in its coffin the 1-hour rest period begins once the stake is removed. If the vampire\u2019s head is severed and anointed with holy water while the stake is in place, the vampire is destroyed.</li> <li><b>Sunlight</b> If exposed to direct sunlight, a vampire immediately becomes slowed 1. The slowed value increases by 1 each time the vampire ends its turn in sunlight. If the vampire loses all its actions in this way, it is destroyed. Due to their supernatural aversion to light, vampires don\u2019t cast shadows or show a reflection in mirrors.</li></ul><b>Climb Speed</b> Vampires gain a climb Speed equal to their land Speed. <b>Claws</b> If the creature had hands, its fingernails thicken and grow, granting it an unarmed claw Strike that deals slashing damage and has the agile trait. If the monster had any agile attacks, the damage dealt by its claws should be roughly the same as the damage dealt by those attacks. If it had only non-agile attacks, its claws should deal three-quarters that damage. <b>Drink Blood</b><img alt=\"Single Action\" class=\"actiondark\" src=\"Images\\Actions\\OneAction.png\" style=\"height:15px; padding:0px 2px 0px 2px\"/><img alt=\"Single Action\" class=\"actionlight\" src=\"Images\\Actions\\OneAction_I.png\" style=\"height:15px; padding:0px 2px 0px 2px\"/> (<a aonid=\"48\" game-obj=\"Traits\">divine</a>, <a aonid=\"117\" game-obj=\"Traits\">necromancy</a>); <b>Requirement</b> A grabbed, paralyzed, restrained, unconscious, or willing creature is within the vampire\u2019s reach. <b>Effect</b> The vampire sinks its fangs into that creature to drink its blood. This requires an Athletics check against the victim\u2019s Fortitude DC if the victim is grabbed and is automatic for any of the other conditions. The victim is drained 1 and the vampire regains HP equal to 10% of its maximum HP, gaining any excess HP as temporary Hit Points. Drinking Blood from a creature that\u2019s already drained doesn\u2019t restore any HP to the vampire but increases the victim\u2019s drain value by 1. A vampire can also consume blood that\u2019s been emptied into a vessel for sustenance, but it gains no HP from doing so. A victim\u2019s drained condition decreases by 1 per week. A blood transfusion, which requires a DC 20 Medicine check and sufficient blood or a blood donor, reduces the drain by 1 after 10 minutes. <b>Grab</b> The creature\u2019s claw attacks (or equivalent unarmed attacks) gain Grab.",

If the new vampire is lower level than its creator, it is under the creator\u2019s control. If a vampire controls too many spawn at once (as determined by the GM), strong-willed spawn can free themselves by succeeding at a Will saving throw against the vampire\u2019s Will DC.<br/><b>Mist Escape</b><img alt=\"Free Action\" class=\"actiondark\" src=\"Images\\Actions\\FreeAction.png\" style=\"height:15px; padding:0px 2px 0px 2px\"/><img alt=\"Free Action\" class=\"actionlight\" src=\"Images\\Actions\\FreeAction_I.png\" style=\"height:15px; padding:0px 2px 0px 2px\"/><b>Trigger</b> The vampire is reduced to 0 HP. <b>Effect</b> The vampire uses Turn to Mist.

Most vampires can turn into a bat, but some can turn into a different creature, such as a rat or a wolf. Use the options in the aerial form and animal form spells as guidelines.<br/> \u2022 <b>Bat</b> The vampire changes into a bat swarm or giant bat. It gains echolocation 40 feet, a land Speed of 20 feet and a fly Speed of 30 feet, and a fangs Strike with the same attack bonus as its highest melee attack. These fangs deal the same amount of damage as the vampire\u2019s claws, but deal piercing damage rather than slashing damage.<br/><b>Children of the Night</b> (<a aonid=\"48\" game-obj=\"Traits\">divine</a>, <a aonid=\"61\" game-obj=\"Traits\">enchantment</a>, <a aonid=\"106\" game-obj=\"Traits\">mental</a>) The vampire\u2019s presence brings forth creatures of the night to do the master\u2019s bidding. These typically include rat swarms, bat swarms, and wolves, but can include other creatures. The vampire can give telepathic orders to these creatures as long as they are within 100 feet, but they can\u2019t communicate back.<br/><b>Dominate</b><img alt=\"Two Actions\" class=\"actiondark\" src=\"Images\\Actions\\TwoActions.png\" style=\"height:15px; padding:0px 2px 0px 2px\"/><img alt=\"Two Actions\" class=\"actionlight\" src=\"Images\\Actions\\TwoActions_I.png\" style=\"height:15px; padding:0px 2px 0px 2px\"/> (<a aonid=\"48\" game-obj=\"Traits\">divine</a>, <a aonid=\"61\" game-obj=\"Traits\">enchantment</a>, <a aonid=\"93\" game-obj=\"Traits\">incapacitation</a>, <a aonid=\"106\" game-obj=\"Traits\">mental</a>, <a aonid=\"163\" game-obj=\"Traits\">visual</a>) The vampire can cast dominate at will as a divine innate spell. Casting it requires staring into the target\u2019s eyes, giving the spell the visual trait. The save DC uses the DC of the vampire\u2019s level, and a creature that succeeds is temporarily immune to that vampire\u2019s Dominate for 24 hours. Fully destroying the vampire ends the domination, but merely reducing the vampire to 0 HP is insufficient to break the spell.<br/><b>Drink Blood</b> As a typical vampire, but the victim is drained 2 instead of 1.<br/><b>Turn to Mist</b><img alt=\"Single Action\" class=\"actiondark\" src=\"Images\\Actions\\OneAction.png\" style=\"height:15px; padding:0px 2px 0px 2px\"/><img alt=\"Single Action\" class=\"actionlight\" src=\"Images\\Actions\\OneAction_I.png\" style=\"height:15px; padding:0px 2px 0px 2px\"/> (<a aonid=\"32\" game-obj=\"Traits\">concentrate</a>, <a aonid=\"48\" game-obj=\"Traits\">divine</a>, <a aonid=\"157\" game-obj=\"Traits\">transmutation</a>) The vampire turns into a cloud of vapor, as the gaseous form spell, or back to its normal form.

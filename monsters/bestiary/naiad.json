While most naiads lead solitary lives close to their chosen ward, sometimes these nymphs congregate in coven-like groups where river tributaries meet, performing great magic and blessing the waters of the land. Because naiads\u2019 bonds to their bodies of water permit more flexibility, they are the nymphs most likely to interact with humanoids and even visit their settlements on occasion. Unlike other nymphs, naiads occasionally become adventurers, especially when dark forces seek to despoil nature or otherwise threaten the land, joining forces with others to prevent the corruption of nature."

On a failure, it is affected as if by the nymph queen\u2019s nymph\u2019s beauty aura; if it was already affected by the aura, it suffers a greater effect described in the nymph queen\u2019s entry. A nymph queen can Focus Beauty on a given creature only once per turn.<br/><b>Inspiration</b><span aria-label=\"Three Actions\" class=\"action action-3\" role=\"img\" title=\"Three Actions\"> </span>  (<a aonid=\"60\" game-obj=\"Traits\">emotion</a>, <a aonid=\"61\" game-obj=\"Traits\">enchantment</a>, <a aonid=\"106\" game-obj=\"Traits\">mental</a>, <a aonid=\"134\" game-obj=\"Traits\">primal</a>) A nymph queen can inspire a single intelligent creature by giving that creature a token of her favor, typically a lock of her hair. As long as the creature carries her token and remains in good standing with the nymph queen, the creature gains a +1 status bonus to all Crafting checks, Performance checks, and Will saves.<br/> If a nymph queen grants her Inspiration to a bard and the nymph queen is that bard\u2019s muse, the bard gains an additional benefit depending on their muse theme: for lore muse, the bard also gains a +1 status bonus to all Lore checks; for maestro muse, the status bonus to Performance checks increases to +2 for the purpose of determining the effects of compositions; for polymath muse, the bard gains a +4 status bonus to untrained skill checks; and for all other muses, the Will save bonus increases to +2 against fey.<br/><b>Nymph\u2019s Beauty</b> (<a aonid=\"206\" game-obj=\"Traits\">aura</a>, <a aonid=\"60\" game-obj=\"Traits\">emotion</a>, <a aonid=\"61\" game-obj=\"Traits\">enchantment</a>, <a aonid=\"106\" game-obj=\"Traits\">mental</a>, <a aonid=\"134\" game-obj=\"Traits\">primal</a>, <a aonid=\"163\" game-obj=\"Traits\">visual</a>) 30 feet. Creatures that start their turn in the aura must succeed at a Will save or suffer an effect described in the nymph queen\u2019s entry.<br/><b>Tied to the Land</b> A nymph queen is intrinsically tied to a specific region, such as a forest for a dryad queen. As long as the queen is healthy, the environment is exceptionally resilient, allowing the nymph queen to automatically attempt to counteract spells and rituals such as blight that would harm the environment, using her Spell DC with a counteract level equal to the highest-level druid spell she can cast. When the nymph queen becomes physically or psychologically unhealthy, however, her warded region eventually becomes twisted or unhealthy as well. In that case, restoring the nymph queen swiftly heals the entire region."

They generally avoid making their lairs too close to civilization, however, to avoid drawing enemies to their homes. Sea hags are known for tempting desperate victims into tragic and inescapable bargains, deals which the hag has already secretly stacked in her favor. Despite their voracious appetites, sea hags appear hideously emaciated, and unlike more powerful hags, they lack the ability to magically disguise their form.  \n  \n Sea hags can join covens, but their aquatic nature often prevents them from joining mixed covens with other kinds of hags.",

Even the smallest mu spores are never less than a hundred feet long from tentacle tip to tentacle tip, yet despite this vast bulk, they are capable of flying with an uncommon grace, venting jets of foul-smelling spores to guide their flight.  \n  \n Many societies tell tales of vast mu spores appearing over cities at the dawn of apocalyptic events, but they\u2019re more than just ravenous eaters of nations. Mu spores often possess rare or esoteric knowledge, and if peaceful contact can be made, this lore can be quite valuable. Their spores can also be used to craft certain foul drugs or deadly alchemical poisons, but harvesting these ingredients is dangerous, as the spores are not viable for long once they\u2019ve been shed, forcing alchemists seeking to harvest them to operate in perilously close proximity to the abominations.",

If a swallowed creature is of the maximum size listed, the monster can\u2019t use Swallow Whole again. If the creature is smaller than the maximum, the monster can usually swallow more creatures; the GM determines the maximum. The monster attempts an Athletics check opposed by the grabbed creature\u2019s Reflex DC. If it succeeds, it swallows the creature. The monster\u2019s mouth or jaws no longer grab a creature it has swallowed, so the monster is free to use them to Strike or Grab once again. The monster can\u2019t attack creatures it has swallowed.  \n  \n A swallowed creature is grabbed, is slowed 1, and has to hold its breath or start suffocating. The swallowed creature takes the listed amount of damage when first swallowed and at the end of each of its turns while it\u2019s swallowed. If the victim Escapes this ability\u2019s grabbed condition, it exits through the monster\u2019s mouth. This frees any other creature grabbed in the monster\u2019s mouth or jaws. A swallowed creature can attack the monster that has swallowed it, but only with unarmed attacks or with weapons of light Bulk or less. The engulfing creature is flat-footed against the attack. If the monster takes piercing or slashing damage equaling or exceeding the listed Rupture value from a single attack or spell, the engulfed creature cuts itself free. A creature that gets free by either Escaping or cutting itself free can immediately breathe and exits the swallowing monster\u2019s space.  \n  \n If the monster dies, a swallowed creature can be freed by creatures adjacent to the corpse if they spend a combined total of 3 actions cutting the monster open with a weapon or unarmed attack that deals piercing or slashing damage.",

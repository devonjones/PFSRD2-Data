Even the smallest mu spores are never less than a hundred feet long from tentacle tip to tentacle tip, yet despite this vast bulk, they are capable of flying with an uncommon grace, venting jets of foul-smelling spores to guide their flight.  \n  \n Many societies tell tales of vast mu spores appearing over cities at the dawn of apocalyptic events, but they\u2019re more than just ravenous eaters of nations. Mu spores often possess rare or esoteric knowledge, and if peaceful contact can be made, this lore can be quite valuable. Their spores can also be used to craft certain foul drugs or deadly alchemical poisons, but harvesting these ingredients is dangerous, as the spores are not viable for long once they\u2019ve been shed, forcing alchemists seeking to harvest them to operate in perilously close proximity to the abominations.",

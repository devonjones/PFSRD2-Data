It ambushes its prey by rushing out from cover and biting the target with its powerful jaws. A giant monitor lizard\u2019s saliva is venomous, allowing it to bring down prey larger than it can easily haul away in its jaws. Giant monitor lizards grow up to 14 feet long, including their long tails, and they weigh about 350 pounds. Their bodies are normally dark brown with patches of yellow or green. When nesting, a giant monitor lizard digs a deep burrow to hide in. The burrow serves as both a safe haven and a location from which the lizard can ambush larger prey such as deer, boars, or even humanoids. A giant monitor lizard can consume nearly its own body weight in a single meal, and its loosely articulated jaws allow it to swallow surprisingly large prey.<br/><br/><b><u><a aonid=\"5\" game-obj=\"Skills\" general=\"true\">Recall Knowledge - Animal</a></u> (<u><a aonid=\"10\" game-obj=\"Skills\">Nature</a></u>)</b>: DC 16",

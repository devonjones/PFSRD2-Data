These homunculi gain the soulbound trait, can speak, and do not have a special link to a creator, yet the process tends to warp the soul used so that, more often than not, what rises in the new homunculus body is a parody of its prior life. As such, soulbound homunculi are generally created by cruel spellcasters as a method of humiliating and tormenting vanquished enemies.",

            "text": "A homunculus is a tiny servitor construct created by a crafter to serve as a spy, scout, messenger, or assistant. When a crafter first begins to study the art of creating constructs, she often crafts a homunculus first, since the creation process is simple and inexpensive due to a magical shortcut: the use of the creator\u2019s own blood. This forges a link between the homunculus and its master, causing the homunculus to gain a spark of the creator\u2019s intellect, as well as the same moral values and some of the creator\u2019s basic personality traits. Homunculi left to their own devices never stray far from their masters.  \n  \n In most cases, a homunculus doesn\u2019t survive the death of its master for long. Deprived of its creator, a homunculus loses focus and grows increasingly self-destructive, and some even end up battering themselves to destruction. Rarely, a homunculus with a slain master survives the trauma with its mind intact, often seeing itself as its deceased creator\u2019s child or successor and attempting to further its creator\u2019s legacy as best it can. In such cases, and if the homunculus was in close proximity to its master upon that creature\u2019s death, a portion of the dead master\u2019s soul \u201cinfects\u201d the surviving homunculus as it passes on to the afterlife. This doesn\u2019t result in a truly soulbound homunculus (see sidebar), since only a fragment of the soul is left behind, but this is still enough to grant the homunculus a greater personality, free will of its own, and perhaps most importantly, the ability to speak. Over time, a few of these \u201cawakened\u201d homunculi even go so far as to become convinced that they are the reincarnation of their prior masters, although their actual personalities never quite reach the depth and complexity of a truly living creature. They are, at best, caricatures of the master, and at worst they become awful, bitter-minded parodies of life itself. Still, a free-willed homunculus might pursue studies in its creator\u2019s class, becoming a unique creature with the abilities of that class if time and fortune permit.  \n  \n Homunculi are created from a mixture of clay, ash, mandrake root, spring water, and a pint of the creator\u2019s own blood. It is possible for a separate donor to provide the blood, but the process is more difficult.",

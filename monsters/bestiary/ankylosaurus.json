Although they\u2019re herbivores, they have been known to attack other creatures that trespass within territory simply out of ill temper.  \n  \n Ankylosauruses have few natural predators, as their bony hides are covered in spiked nubs that jut in many different directions to discourage larger creatures from biting them. They have mighty tails ending in an immense knot of bone, which they use to whip at threats with incredible speed and power. While these low-to-the-ground dinosaurs can trample human-sized or smaller foes, their relatively squat stance prevents them from doing so against larger targets. An ankylosaurus is about 30 feet long, 10 feet tall at the shoulder, and weighs over 3 tons.  \n  \n The ankylosaurus is the largest of the heavily armored dinosaurs called ankylosaurids, but smaller versions exist as well. Still Large in size, these smaller dinosaurs, such as the 16-foot long pinacosaurus, lack the trample ability and are rarely above 4th level. Regardless of size, ankylosaurids tend to be relatively muted in coloration, with mixes of black, brown, and gray. When captive, an ankylosaurus\u2019s keeper might paint its scales bright colors to signify to others that is not a wild creature.",

They\u2019re often found in isolated lands like primeval jungle valleys or plateaus\u2014regions known as lost worlds for their inaccessibility and lack of any encroaching civilization. In addition to dinosaurs, other megafauna can exist in these places as well, along with giant insects or aggressive creatures like bulettes, carnivorous plants, chuuls, and drakes. Such regions can make for perilous and intriguing adventure sites, especially if you combine them with ruins of ancient civilizations to explore once the party has navigated the hostile wilderness regions.",

Lizardfolk, orcs, giants, and other monstrous humanoids sometimes use dinosaurs as mounts, guards, or hunting animals. Humans and other ancestries have also been known to collect dinosaurs, be it to display them in menageries or keep them as exotic pets or guardians. Such activities are generally pursuits of the rich or eccentric, but certain druids and other guardians of nature feel strong kinships with dinosaurs as well and take them on as companions. When dinosaurs establish themselves in regions beyond their normal habitats, it is generally the result of these captive creatures escaping into the wild.",

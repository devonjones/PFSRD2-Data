The most infamous zaramuuns kill any living creatures they find, but others simply rob their victims of all metal and stone possessions before fleeing. Although zaramuuns insist they are only reclaiming what was taken from their ancestral earth, this is simple self-delusion; most zaramuuns use their stolen goods as payment and material components to conjure fiends, for Zaramuuns were exiled from the Plane of Earth after worshipping fiends who promised to give them power over other elementals. This worship gradually transformed into servitude, and now many zaramuuns believe that if they send enough souls to their masters, they will be set free.",

An engulfed creature can attack the monster engulfing it, but only with unarmed attacks or with weapons of light Bulk or less. The engulfing creature is flat-footed against the attack. If the monster takes piercing or slashing damage equaling or exceeding the listed Rupture value from a single attack or spell, the engulfed creature cuts itself free. A creature that gets free by either method can immediately breathe and exits the swallowing monster\u2019s space.  \n  \n If the monster dies, all creatures it has engulfed are automatically released as the monster\u2019s form loses cohesion.",

Cyth-V\u2019sug was unable (or perhaps only unwilling) to pursue but took steps to ensure that Treerazer would remain there by exiling him, severing Treerazer\u2019s bond to the Abyss\u2014if the Lord of the Blasted Tarn is slain, his animus will not return to the Abyss and reform.

Some believe that no eldritch force contains Treerazer and that, were he willing, he could travel Golarion with impunity, spreading the twisted blessings of his touch and the corruption of his presence, yet the Lord of the Blasted Tarn is as cunning and canny as he is deadly, and prefers to work his evils on the world from the safety of his nightmare realm.",

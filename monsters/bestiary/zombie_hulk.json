Most zombies have one of these abilities; If you give a zombie more, you might want to increase its level and adjust its statistics. The DCs use the zombie's level from the Spell DC and Spell Attack Bonus table.  \n **Disgusting Pustules** (disease, necromancy) The zombie is covered in pustules that rupture when it takes any piercing damage or any critical hit. In either case, adjacent creatures are hit with vile fluid, causing them to become sickened 1 unless they succeed at a Fortitude save.  \n **Feast** [##] (manipulate) If the zombie is adjacent to a helpless or unconscious creature, or a deceased creature that died in the past hour, the zombie can feast upon its flesh to heal itself. This restores an amount of Hit Points equal to the zombie's level. If the creature is alive, the zombie deals damage equal to its jaws, flst, or claw damage.  \n **Plague-Ridden** (disease, necromancy) The zombie carries a plague that can create more of its own kind. This functions as the plague zombie's zombie rot, except at stage 5, the victim rises as another of the zombie's type, rather than a plague zombie.  \n **Rotting Aura** (aura, disease, necromancy) The zombie emits an aura of rot and disease that causes wounds to fester and turn sour. Any living creature that starts its turn within 10 feet of the zombie and is not at full Hit Points takes 1d6 damage as its wounds fester. This damage increases by 1d6 for every 6 levels the zombie has. Creatures that take a critical hit from the zombie also take this damage immediately.  \n **Unkillable** This zombie is nigh unkillable. The zombie loses its weakness to slashing and gains resistance against all damage equal to its level (minimum 3), and it gains weakness equal to twice its level (minimum 6) to critical hits. Increase the zombie's level by 1 if you give it this ability.",

While prone, the zombie isn't flat-footed, it ignores the status penalty to its attack rolls, and it gains a +2 circumstance bonus to Athletics checks to Trip. The zombie can also move up to half its Speed when it Crawls.   \n  \n**Persistent Limbs** The first time the zombie is critically hit with a melee or ranged Strike, a limb falls off its body and continues to attack. The limb acts on the zombie's initiative; each round it can Stride up to half the zombie's Speed and make a Strike. The limb uses and contributes to the zombie's multiple attack penalty.   \n  \n**Putrid Stench** (aura, olfactory) 15 feet. The zombie's rotting flesh is particularly malodorous. A creature that enters the area must attempt a Fortitude save. On a failure, the creature is sickened 1, and on a critical failure, the creature also takes a \u20135-foot status penalty to its Speeds for 1 round. While within the aura, the creature takes a \u20132 circumstance penalty to saves to recover from the sickened condition. A creature that succeeds at its save is temporarily immune to all zombies' putrid stenches for 1 minute.   \n  \n**Unholy Speed** The zombie gains a +10 status bonus to all its Speeds",

Its initiative is immediately after the zombie's. If the swarm is 4 or more levels lower than the zombie, it isn't worth XP (and doesn't add its XP to the encounter budget).  \n  \n **Spitting Zombie** The zombie spits acid as a ranged Strike with a range of 30 feet. This uses the highest attack bonus among the zombie's Strikes and deals 1d12 acid damage per 3 levels of the zombie (or 1d6 acid damage below level 3). On a critical hit, the target also takes 1d4 persistent acid damage per 3 levels of the zombie. Once used, the zombie must spend 1 action to cough up enough acid to use this ability again.  \n  \n **Tearing Grapple** The zombies work in groups to rip foes to pieces. Whenever a zombie with this ability successfully Grapples a foe that's already grabbed or restrained by another zombie with this ability, they violently struggle over the poor victim, dealing fist damage (or a similar Strike's damage if the zombie doesn't have a fist Strike). If the grapple is a critical success, the target takes double damage and ceases being grabbed or restrained by any other creatures. If the zombie has the Grab ability, using Grab deals half its fist Strike damage to the target.",

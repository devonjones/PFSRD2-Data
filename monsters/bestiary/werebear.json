This indignation can still manifest in violent ways, though, as a transformed werebear becomes temporarily blind to its alliances and has little control over its bestial temper. As a result, werebears are loners, rarely even living together as families longer than necessary. Werebears know that as long as they live solitary lives, they can serve as protectors and guardians in wilderness regions without the overwhelming fear that, when the moon is full and the curse takes hold, they will rage against an innocent bystander or loved one. As long as there is nothing around to threaten it or the natural area it protects (typically a forest), a werebear in its animal form is generally content to forage and sleep away the night.<br/><br/><b><u><a aonid=\"5\" game-obj=\"Skills\" general=\"true\">Recall Knowledge - Beast</a></u> (<u><a aonid=\"2\" game-obj=\"Skills\">Arcana</a></u>, <u><a aonid=\"10\" game-obj=\"Skills\">Nature</a></u>)</b>: DC 21<br/><b><u><a aonid=\"5\" game-obj=\"Skills\" general=\"true\">Recall Knowledge - Humanoid</a></u> (<u><a aonid=\"14\" game-obj=\"Skills\">Society</a></u>)</b>: DC 21"

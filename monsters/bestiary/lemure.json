Those who succumb to these temptations find themselves consigned to an afterlife of endless torment in the pits of Hell, wherein the only hope of escape lies in the chance of being promoted to become a devil in the infernal ranks. Every devil has a specific role to play in the upkeep of the remorseless bureaucratic machine that is Hell, from soldiers and scholars to inquisitors, lawyers, judges, and executioners. Lowly lemures and imps perform subservient labor to more powerful and specialized devils, such as contract devils and erinyes, while the greatest pit fiends command entire infernal armies.",

The devil picks one of the following orders lemures can understand, and the lemures follow that order. The command and its effects end once the commander is out of the lemure\u2019s sight, a new command is issued by the same or another devil, or the lemure dies. \n* **Kill** The lemure attacks one target the commander singles out and gains a +1 circumstance bonus to attack rolls against the target.\n* **Defend** The lemure circles the commander and attacks any creature that comes near. It gains a +1 circumstance bonus to AC and saves.\n* **Fetch** The lemure gains a +10\u2013foot circumstance bonus to its Speed and attempts to get an object or person the commander singles out. It attacks anyone and anything that gets in the way.\n* **Work** The lemure performs drudge work dictated by the commander."

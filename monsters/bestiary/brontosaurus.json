Brontosauruses have stout bodies and long, sinuous necks ending in small heads, allowing them to graze from the highest treetops. Their powerful tails are equally as long as their necks and provide counterbalances. Brontosauruses bear their bulk upon four stout legs. Although their feet are capable of crushing entire buildings, these herbivores are generally peaceful and considerate of where they step.  \n  \n Most brontosauruses are dangerous only when defending themselves or their young, or when panicked enough to stampede. When roused in this way, however, the creatures are truly terrifying: their muscular tails sweep in great arcs and their massive feet crash down heedlessly onto the ground. A brontosaurus is 70 feet long and weighs more than 30 tons.  \n  \n Brontosauruses belong to a group of dinosaurs known as sauropods, all of which are immense in size. The brachiosaurus is among the tallest of these dinosaurs, and the diplodocus among the longest, but it\u2019s likely that even larger behemoths exist.",

In addition to dinosaurs, other megafauna can exist in these places as well, along with giant insects or aggressive creatures like bulettes, carnivorous plants, chuuls, and drakes. Such regions can make for perilous and intriguing adventure sites, especially if you combine them with ruins of ancient civilizations to explore once the party has navigated the hostile wilderness regions.",

Lizardfolk, orcs, giants, and other monstrous humanoids sometimes use dinosaurs as mounts, guards, or hunting animals. Humans and other ancestries have also been known to collect dinosaurs, be it to display them in menageries or keep them as exotic pets or guardians. Such activities are generally pursuits of the rich or eccentric, but certain druids and other guardians of nature feel strong kinships with dinosaurs as well and take them on as companions. When dinosaurs establish themselves in regions beyond their normal habitats, it is generally the result of these captive creatures escaping into the wild.",

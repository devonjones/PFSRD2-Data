The following examples are among the world\u2019s most infamous graveknights at large, and may inspire or serve as villains in your own games.<br/><br/><b>Lictor Shokneir:</b> Once the Hellknight leader of the notorious Order of the Crux, Lictor Shokneir was disgraced when he refused a royal order to disband his army of butchers. The other Hellknights surrounded him and razed his castle, Citadel Gheisteno, to the ground. However, Shokneir\u2019s determination sustains his now-undead form, and he and his undead legions have rebuilt the citadel in all its haunting glory.<br/><br/><b>The Black Prince:</b> Although the graveknight known simply as the Black Prince was redeemed centuries ago as part of Iomedae\u2019s 11 Acts, it is said that the prince\u2019s armor remains intact\u2014and that vile forces conspire to reclaim it. If the armor is donned by one of the Black Prince\u2019s descendants, the Inner Sea will be beset by a terrible villain indeed.",

If the body is destroyed before then, the process restarts. A graveknight can only be permanently destroyed by obliterating its armor (such as with disintegrate), transporting it to the Positive Energy Plane, or throwing it into the heart of a volcano.<br/><b>Immunities</b> death effects, disease, paralyzed, poison, precision, unconscious, plus one energy type (the same chosen for ruinous weapons below).<br/><b>Sacrilegious Aura</b> (<a aonid=\"2\" game-obj=\"Traits\">abjuration</a>, <a aonid=\"206\" game-obj=\"Traits\">aura</a>, <a aonid=\"48\" game-obj=\"Traits\">divine</a>, <a aonid=\"64\" game-obj=\"Traits\">evil</a>) 30 feet.

Creatures in the area take 1d12 damage, plus an additional 1d12 damage for every two levels the graveknight has (basic Reflex save). The graveknight can use this ability once every 1d4 rounds. This energy damage is of the same type as that of its ruinous weapons (see below); Devastating Blast gains the associated energy trait.<br/><b>Phantom Mount</b><img alt=\"Three Actions\" class=\"actiondark\" src=\"Images\\Actions\\ThreeActions.png\" style=\"height:15px; padding:0px 2px 0px 2px\"/><img alt=\"Three Actions\" class=\"actionlight\" src=\"Images\\Actions\\ThreeActions_I.png\" style=\"height:15px; padding:0px 2px 0px 2px\"/> (<a aonid=\"11\" game-obj=\"Traits\">arcane</a>, <a aonid=\"33\" game-obj=\"Traits\">conjuration</a>, <a aonid=\"154\" game-obj=\"Traits\">summon</a>) The graveknight summons a supernatural mount as per phantom steed, heightened to a level equal to half the graveknight\u2019s level. Unlike phantom steed, the steed\u2019s AC and saving throw bonuses are all 4 lower than the graveknight\u2019s, and the steed has one-third the graveknight\u2019s Hit Points (rounded down). If the steed is destroyed, the graveknight must wait 1 hour before using this ability again.<br/><b>Ruinous Weapons</b> At the time of its creation, a graveknight chooses one of the following energy types that was relevant to its life or death: acid, cold, electricity, or fire. Any weapon the graveknight wields gains the effects of the caustic, frost, shock, or flaming weapon rune, respectively, in addition to a +1 striking weapon rune. If the graveknight is 14th level or higher, its weapons instead gain the effects of the greater versions of both of these runes.<br/><b>Weapon Master</b> The graveknight has access to the critical specialization effects of any weapons it wields.

It loses any abilities that come from it being a living creature and any traits that represent its life, such as <a aonid=\"90\" game-obj=\"Traits\">human</a> and <a aonid=\"91\" game-obj=\"Traits\">humanoid</a>.<br/><b><a aonid=\"12\" game-obj=\"MonsterAbilities\">Darkvision</a></b><br/><b><a aonid=\"42\" game-obj=\"MonsterAbilities\">Negative Healing</a></b><br/><b>Rejuvenation</b> (<a aonid=\"48\" game-obj=\"Traits\">divine</a>, <a aonid=\"117\" game-obj=\"Traits\">necromancy</a>) When a graveknight is destroyed, its armor rebuilds its body over the course of 1d10 days\u2014or more quickly if the armor is worn by a living host (see Graveknight Armor, below). If the body is destroyed before then, the process restarts. A graveknight can only be permanently destroyed by obliterating its armor (such as with disintegrate), transporting it to the Positive Energy Plane, or throwing it into the heart of a volcano.<br/><b>Immunities</b><a aonid=\"40\" game-obj=\"Traits\">death</a> effects, <a aonid=\"46\" game-obj=\"Traits\">disease</a>, <a aonid=\"28\" game-obj=\"Conditions\">paralyzed</a>, <a aonid=\"126\" game-obj=\"Traits\">poison</a>, precision, <a aonid=\"38\" game-obj=\"Conditions\">unconscious</a>, plus one energy type (the same chosen for ruinous weapons below).<br/><b>Sacrilegious Aura</b> (<a aonid=\"2\" game-obj=\"Traits\">abjuration</a>, <a aonid=\"206\" game-obj=\"Traits\">aura</a>, <a aonid=\"48\" game-obj=\"Traits\">divine</a>, <t>evil) 30 feet. When a creature in the aura uses a <a aonid=\"128\" game-obj=\"Traits\">positive</a> spell or ability, the graveknight automatically attempts to <a aonid=\"371\" game-obj=\"Rules\">counteract</a> it, with the listed counteract modifier.<br/> <b>Devastating Blast</b> <span aria-label=\"Two Actions\" class=\"action action-2\" role=\"img\" title=\"Two Actions\"> </span>  (<a aonid=\"11\" game-obj=\"Traits\">arcane</a>, <a aonid=\"65\" game-obj=\"Traits\">evocation</a>) The graveknight unleashes a 30-foot cone of energy. Creatures in the area take 1d12 damage, plus an additional 1d12 damage for every two levels the graveknight has (<a aonid=\"329\" game-obj=\"Rules\">basic</a> Reflex save). The graveknight can use this ability once every 1d4 rounds. This energy damage is of the same type as that of its ruinous weapons (see below); Devastating Blast gains the associated energy trait.<br/> <b>Phantom Mount</b> <span aria-label=\"Three Actions\" class=\"action action-3\" role=\"img\" title=\"Three Actions\"> </span>  (<a aonid=\"11\" game-obj=\"Traits\">arcane</a>, <a aonid=\"33\" game-obj=\"Traits\">conjuration</a>, <a aonid=\"154\" game-obj=\"Traits\">summon</a>) The graveknight summons a supernatural mount as per <a aonid=\"221\" game-obj=\"Spells\"><i>phantom steed</i></a>, heightened to a level equal to half the graveknight's level. Unlike <i>phantom steed</i>, the steed's AC and saving throw bonuses are all 4 lower than the graveknight's, and the steed has one-third the graveknight's Hit Points (rounded down). If the steed is destroyed, the graveknight must wait 1 hour before using this ability again.<br/> <b>Ruinous Weapons</b> At the time of its creation, a graveknight chooses one of the following energy types that was relevant to its life or death: <a aonid=\"3\" game-obj=\"Traits\">acid</a>, <a aonid=\"27\" game-obj=\"Traits\">cold</a>, <a aonid=\"56\" game-obj=\"Traits\">electricity</a>, or <a aonid=\"72\" game-obj=\"Traits\">fire</a>. Any weapon the graveknight wields gains the effects of the <a aonid=\"292\" game-obj=\"Equipment\"><i>corrosive</i></a>, <a aonid=\"296\" game-obj=\"Equipment\"><i>frost</i></a>, <a aonid=\"303\" game-obj=\"Equipment\"><i>shock</i></a>, or <a aonid=\"295\" game-obj=\"Equipment\"><i>flaming</i></a> weapon rune, respectively, in addition to a <i>+1 <a aonid=\"280\" game-obj=\"Equipment\">striking</a></i> weapon rune. If the graveknight is 14th level or higher, its weapons instead gain the effects of the greater versions of both of these runes.<br/> <b>Weapon Master</b> The graveknight has access to the <rules>critical specialization effects of any weapons it wields. <h3 class=\"title\">Alternate Graveknight Abilities</h3> You can create a more unusual graveknight by substituting one of their  abilities (except for darkvision, negative healing, rejuvenation, or immunities) with one of the following.<br/> <h3 class=\"framing\">Bestiary</h3> <b>Betrayed Revivification</b> The graveknight died after being deeply betrayed. Instead of being immune to a type of energy damage, it is immune to <a aonid=\"106\" game-obj=\"Traits\">mental</a> damage, its weapons deal 1d6 additional mental damage, and its Devastating Blast deals mental damage with a Will saving throw instead of Reflex.<br/> <b>Create Grave Squire</b> The graveknight can gift a piece of its armor to a willing ally, which becomes its grave squire. The graveknight can communicate telepathically with its squire at any distance, see through the squire's senses, and cast <a aonid=\"315\" game-obj=\"Spells\"><i>suggestion</i></a> as a divine innate spell through the telepathic link at will; the squire treats its degree of success as one step worse. If the graveknight's main armor is destroyed, the squire's piece expands to cover the squire's body over 1d10 days, after which point it becomes the graveknight's new body. The graveknight can have only one squire at a time, and must recover the gifted piece of armor if it wishes to create a new squire.<br/> <b>Dark Deliverance</b> The graveknight has positive resistance equal to its level. <h3 class=\"framing\">Pathfinder #172: Secrets of the Temple City</h3> <b>Channel Magic</b> <span aria-label=\"Two Actions\" class=\"action action-2\" role=\"img\" title=\"Two Actions\"> </span>  The graveknight redirects magical energies through its armor, allowing it to deliver magic through an attack. The graveknight Casts a Spell that takes 1 or 2 actions to cast and requires a spell attack roll. The effects of the spell don't occur immediately but are imbued into an attack instead. The graveknight then makes a melee Strike with a weapon or <a aonid=\"199\" game-obj=\"Traits\">unarmed</a> attack. The spell is coupled with the attack, using the attack roll result to determine the effects of both the Strike and the spell. This counts as two attacks for the graveknight's multiple attack penalty but doesn't apply the penalty until after it's completed Channeling Magic. The graveknight can't use Channel Magic again for 1d4 rounds.<h3 class=\"framing\">Book Of The Dead</h3> <br/> <b>Clutching Armor</b> <span aria-label=\"Reaction\" class=\"action action-4\" role=\"img\" title=\"Reaction\"> </span>  (<a aonid=\"11\" game-obj=\"Traits\">arcane</a>, <a aonid=\"157\" game-obj=\"Traits\">transmutation</a>) <b>Trigger</b> A creature attempts to move away from the graveknight; <b>Effect</b> The graveknight's armor animates and attempts to Grab the triggering creature. It makes an <a aonid=\"3\" game-obj=\"Skills\">Athletics</a> check to <a aonid=\"35\" game-obj=\"Actions\">Grapple</a> using the graveknight's Athletics modifier \u2013 2. The armor can continue to Grapple the creature normally. Since the armor is grappling the creature, the graveknight doesn't need a free hand to do so.<br/><b>Eager for Battle</b> (<a aonid=\"76\" game-obj=\"Traits\">fortune</a>) When the graveknight rolls initiative, they roll twice and take the better result. They're <a aonid=\"32\" game-obj=\"Conditions\">quickened</a> during their first round after rolling initiative and can use this extra action to Step, Stride, or Strike.<br/> <b>Empty Save for Dust</b> The graveknight's armor contains nothing more than swirling dust that puffs out from joints in their armor. A living creature that touches or is touched by the graveknight (including one hit by the graveknight's fist Strike) must succeed at a Reflex saving throw or become contaminated with the dust. While contaminated, the targeted creature is <a aonid=\"37\" game-obj=\"Conditions\">stupefied 1</a> and gains weakness to the graveknight's energy damage equal to half the graveknight's level. The contamination ends after 1 minute or when the creature is doused with water, whichever occurs first. <br/><b>Graveknight's Shield</b> (<a aonid=\"11\" game-obj=\"Traits\">arcane</a>, <a aonid=\"117\" game-obj=\"Traits\">necromancy</a>) The graveknight's curse extends to their shield, or the graveknight's armor uses a portion of itself to produce a shield. The graveknight has a shield that uses the statistics of a <a aonid=\"327\" game-obj=\"Equipment\"><i>sturdy shield</i></a> of a level no higher than the graveknight's level \u2013 1. The shield is quasi-independent of the graveknight and automatically protects the graveknight from harm. When the shield is raised, it automatically uses <a aonid=\"32\" game-obj=\"MonsterAbilities\">Shield Block</a> to reduce the damage of the first attack against the graveknight each round without the graveknight needing to spend their reaction to do so. The shield automatically rejuvenates with the rest of the graveknight and must be destroyed in the same manner as the graveknight's armor.<br/><b>Portentous Glare</b> (<a aonid=\"206\" game-obj=\"Traits\">aura</a>, <a aonid=\"48\" game-obj=\"Traits\">divine</a>, <a aonid=\"60\" game-obj=\"Traits\">emotion</a>, <a aonid=\"61\" game-obj=\"Traits\">enchantment</a>, <a aonid=\"68\" game-obj=\"Traits\">fear</a>, <a aonid=\"106\" game-obj=\"Traits\">mental</a>, <a aonid=\"163\" game-obj=\"Traits\">visual</a>) 30 feet. The graveknight's visage is one of overwhelming menace. When a creature ends its turn in the aura, it must attempt a Will saving throw. A creature that fails is <a aonid=\"9\" game-obj=\"Conditions\">doomed 1</a> (or doomed 1 and <a aonid=\"19\" game-obj=\"Conditions\">frightened 2</a> on a critical failure). The graveknight can activate or deactivate the aura by using an Interact action to open or close their helmet visor.<h2 class=\"title\">Graveknight Armor</h2> Wearing graveknight armor is very risky, for the graveknight's essence rapidly parasitizes the new wearer, accelerating the graveknight's rejuvenation. This agonizing transformation inevitably kills the host, transforming their flesh into the graveknight's new body. Removing the curse allows a character to remove the armor, but if it ever wears the armor again, the curse returns. If the wearer dies from another cause while wearing the armor, or if the graveknight's rejuvenation completes before the wearer dies from the curse, the wearer immediately progresses to stage 3.<br/> <b>Graveknight's Curse</b> (<a aonid=\"11\" game-obj=\"Traits\">arcane</a>, <a aonid=\"38\" game-obj=\"Traits\">curse</a>, <a aonid=\"117\" game-obj=\"Traits\">necromancy</a>) This curse affects anyone who wears a graveknight's armor for at least 1 hour. <b>Saving Throw</b> Will save; <b>Onset</b> 1 hour; <b>Stage 1</b> doomed 1 and cannot remove the armor (1 day); <b>Stage 2</b> doomed 2, hampered 10, and cannot remove the armor (1 day); <b>Stage 3</b> dies and transforms into the armor's graveknight.<h3 class=\"title\"> <img alt=\"Sidebar - Additional Lore\" src=\"Images\\Icons\\Sidebar_2_AdditionalLore.png\" style=\"height:18px; padding:2px 10px 0px 2px\" title=\"Sidebar - Additional Lore\"/> Arts of War</h3>Graveknights don't arise from mere soldiers but from great tacticians who've won countless engagements. Often, they were once their land's mightiest general or most decorated war hero. This means graveknights don't just rush into a toe-to-toe melee. They've studied the land (often with the experienced and unrelenting gaze only the undead can bring to bear) and engineered troop movements, earthworks, and traps to ensure victory. They usually have reinforcements ready to deploy and redundant contingencies in place. Just as great strategists opine that an engagement is decided before the first blow is landed, a combat against a graveknight often feels like a desperate fight in a rapidly closing vise.<h3 class=\"title\"> <img alt=\"Sidebar - Related Creatures\" src=\"Images\\Icons\\Sidebar_4_RelatedCreatures.png\" style=\"height:18px; padding:2px 10px 0px 2px\" title=\"Sidebar - Related Creatures\"/> Infamous Graveknights</h3>Several of Golarion's most notorious villains are graveknights. The following examples are among the world's most infamous graveknights at large, and may inspire or serve as villains in your own games.<br/><br/> <b>Lictor Shokneir:</b> Once the Hellknight leader of the notorious Order of the Crux, Lictor Shokneir was disgraced when he refused a royal order to disband his army of butchers. The other Hellknights surrounded him and razed his castle, Citadel Gheisteno, to the ground. However, Shokneir's determination sustains his now-undead form, and he and his undead legions have rebuilt the citadel in all its haunting glory.<br/><br/> <b>The Black Prince:</b> Although the graveknight known simply as the Black Prince was redeemed centuries ago as part of Iomedae's 11 Acts, it is said that the prince's armor remains intact\u2014and that vile forces conspire to reclaim it. If the armor is donned by one of the Black Prince's descendants, the Inner Sea will be beset by a terrible villain indeed. <h3 class=\"title\"> <img alt=\"Sidebar - Advice and Rules\" src=\"Images\\Icons\\Sidebar_1_AdviceAndRules.png\" style=\"height:18px; padding:2px 10px 0px 2px\" title=\"Sidebar - Advice and Rules\"/> Other Powers</h3>You can use the alternate abilities as examples to create new powers reflecting a graveknight's personality or history, or even swap out more than one power. Graveknights should be unique and memorable foes.<h3 class=\"title\"> <img alt=\"Sidebar - Advice and Rules\" src=\"Images\\Icons\\Sidebar_1_AdviceAndRules.png\" style=\"height:18px; padding:2px 10px 0px 2px\" title=\"Sidebar - Advice and Rules\"/> Steed Adaptations</h3>For some graveknights, their mount is more than a projection of their desire to move quickly around a battlefield. A graveknight's <a aonid=\"221\" game-obj=\"Spells\"><i>phantom steed</i></a> might have the appearance, resistances, or movement of a favored mount the knight rode as a mortal, such as a <a aonid=\"308\" game-obj=\"Monsters\">nightmare's</a> resistance to fire or a <a aonid=\"329\" game-obj=\"Monsters\">pegasus's</a> Fly Speed.<h3 class=\"title\"> <img alt=\"Sidebar - Additional Lore\" src=\"Images\\Icons\\Sidebar_2_AdditionalLore.png\" style=\"height:18px; padding:2px 10px 0px 2px\" title=\"Sidebar - Additional Lore\"/> Unique Destruction</h3>While most graveknight armors can be destroyed with the standard means of destruction, particularly powerful graveknights might have more durable armor that requires additional steps to destroy. These are usually the armors of high-level graveknights, and their destruction steps are tied to the creation of the graveknight. For example, a specific graveknight armor can't be destroyed until it's struck by a descendant of the person that originally felled the graveknight in battle before their transformation.</rules></t>"

In the case of the baomal, extensive research suggests that neither of these explanations are accurate. No ancient texts have yet been recovered in which a wizard claims to have created the first baomal. And while the alghollthu of today use them as warbeasts, ancient carvings suggest that in the earliest days, baomals were ravenous hunters of alghollthus.",

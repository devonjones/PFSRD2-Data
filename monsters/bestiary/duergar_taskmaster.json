Notorious slavers, duergars regularly raid other Darklands settlements as well as surface communities in constant search of living beings to task with endless amounts of work in their harsh and exhausting settlements.  \n  \n Duergars are gray-skinned creatures, often referred to as \u201cashen\u201d by those surface dwarves willing to speak of them. These subterranean dwarves have a strong natural connection with cave-dwelling vermin, and it\u2019s common to see duergar caravans drawn by teams of immense beetles. Most duergars devote themselves to the worship of Droskar, a taskmaster of a god who demands back-breaking toil in addition to regular prayer. Duergar leadership often consists of powerful divine servants of Droskar, along with incredibly stout warriors whose martial prowess ensures they can overcome any direct threat to their rule. Almost every aspect of duergar society is controlled by a strict hierarchy of leadership, with taskmasters directing subordinates across all walks of life.",

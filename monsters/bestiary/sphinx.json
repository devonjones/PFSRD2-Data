They are often maligned in legends as nothing more than monsters, and though they are quick to anger and are capable of exacting deadly retribution for perceived slights, they are also very intelligent.  \n  \n Sphinxes are often associated with desert regions, but they can dwell in more moderate climates as well. They form small groups consisting of a single, extended family that hunts and works together to protect and teach their young. As they mature, sphinxes develop a wanderlust, a drive to gather hidden lore and solve the world\u2019s greatest riddles\u2014the trait that is perhaps most often identified with their kind.  \n  \n While sometimes bound into service as guardians for powerful spellcasters, lone sphinxes may also be encountered on journeys of discovery and as purveyors of esoteric lore. If treated with the proper respect\u2014and fed well\u2014a sphinx can demonstrate a willingness to exchange information. Their favorite currency is, of course, riddles and secrets. One who can trade knowledge for knowledge has a much better chance of succeeding while bargaining with a sphinx. However, a sphinx\u2019s insatiable thirst for new riddles as well their extensive collection of secrets accumulated over hundreds of years of life\u2014makes it difficult to offer them something they don\u2019t already know. Those who attempt to trade petty insight and stale riddles may invoke a sphinx\u2019s ire and will not live long enough to regret it.",

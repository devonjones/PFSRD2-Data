Each kind of daemon represents a different way to die, and their powers are nearly always aimed at spreading that particular form of death. Through the use of these powers, they seek to drag all existence down into a pit of hopelessness and despair, and to commit all souls to oblivion.  \n  \n While those who summon daemons to the Material Plane usually seek to use the creatures\u2019 destructive and corrupting powers for their own ends, daemons always look for ways to spread fear, doubt, and despair wherever they go. Often, daemons disguise their plots as the workings of other fiends, knowing that such confusion compounds mortals\u2019 fear.  \n  \n While all fiends seek to tempt mortals into lives of evil to increase their own numbers and power on their native planes, daemons are further driven by a supernatural hunger for mortal souls and use a variety of methods\u2014not least of which is the cacodaemons\u2019 soul gems\u2014to entrap them. On Abaddon and in other forbidding places across the multiverse, souls are simultaneously a delicacy, a trade good, and a source of magical power, and the daemons are among the greatest gluttons, merchants, and abusers of this spiritual \u201cresource.\u201d",

Unless otherwise noted, the battle form prevents you from casting spells, speaking, and using most manipulate actions that require hands.

When it does, the cacodaemon grows a fist-sized soul gem (Hardness 2, HP 8) in its gut and can regurgitate it at any time as an Interact action. Destroying the gem frees the soul within but does not return the deceased creature to life. The caster of a spell to return a creature to life whose soul is trapped within a soul gem must succeed at a DC 30 Religion check. On a success, the soul gem shatters and the creature is returned to life as normal for the spell.  \n By using an Interact action, a fiend can ingest a soul gem it is holding, condemning the soul to the fiend\u2019s home plane. The fiend gains fast healing 5 for 1 minute."

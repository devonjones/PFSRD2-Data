Stench (aura, olfactory) 10 feet A creature entering the aura or starting its turn in the aura must succeed at a Fortitude save (use a DC based on the monster\u2019s level; Core Rulebook 503) or become sickened 1 (plus slowed 1 as long as its sickened on a critical failure). While within the aura, the creature takes a \u20132 circumstance penalty to saves against disease and to recover from the sickened condition. A creature that succeeds at its save is temporarily immune for 1 minute. Claws and Jaws As ghoul, but apply ghast fever instead of ghoul fever. Consume Flesh  As ghoul, but it regains 1d6 additional Hit Points. Ghast Fever (disease) Saving Throw Fortitude; Stage 1 carrier with no ill effect (1 day); Stage 2 3d8 negative damage and regains half as many Hit Points from all healing (1 day); Stage 3 as stage 2 (1 day); Stage 4 3d8 negative damage and gains no benefit from healing (1 day); Stage 5 as stage 4 (1 day); Stage 6 dead, and rises as a ghast the next midnight Paralysis (incapacitation, occult, necromancy) As ghoul, but elves are not immune. Ghoulish SocietyGhouls are quite intelligent and, more so than almost any other undead, prone to forming societies and cultures (if vile and repugnant ones centered around flesh eating and acts of depravity) in tangled warrens below boneyards, or even entire cities hidden away in the depths of the Darklands. The First GhoulsLegend holds that the first humanoid (an elf, as it so happened) to feed upon the flesh of his brother rose as a ghoul after death, in time embracing his new life and ascending to great power as a demon lord of ghouls, graves, and secrets kept by the dead. That ghouls of humanoids warp and twist to take vaguely elven features, and that elves themselves are immune to ghoul paralysis, are unusual side effects of this ancient source, yet today, ghouls are as likely to worship other vile gods\u2014or simply eschew faith entirely\u2014as they are to honor the first of their kind.",

The monsters in this section are built from the ground up, so their numbers don\u2019t match these guidelines exactly. Custom-building ghouls is recommended if you have time, using the special abilities listed here but creating the other statistics to match what you want the ghoul to be. First, increase the creature\u2019s level by 1 and change its statistics as follows. <ul><li>Increase its AC, attack bonuses, DCs, saving throws, and skill modifiers by 1.</li> <li>Increase its damage with Strikes and other offensive abilities by 1. If the creature is limited in how often it can use an ability (such as a breath weapon), increase the damage by 2 instead.</li></ul>",

If it had any agile attacks, the damage dealt by its claws should be roughly the same as the damage dealt by those attacks. If it had only non-agile attacks, its claws should deal three-quarters that damage.<br/><b>Jaws</b> If the creature had a mouth, it gains a jaws Strike (an unarmed attack that deals slashing damage plus ghoul fever and paralysis).

Ninth night had just enough moonlight to make out them things out there, caperin' about. Started whisperin' on the night sixteen. And they said nothin' I wasn't already thinkin', about my empty belly and what I'd do for a bite to fill it. Gods forgive me, I was just so hungry. So hungry.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u0094Bronze Bunyip, logbook, final entry\n The First GhoulsLegend holds that the first humanoid (an elf, as it so happened) to feed upon the flesh of his brother rose as a ghoul after death, in time embracing his new life and ascending to great power as a demon lord of ghouls, graves, and secrets kept by the dead. That ghouls of humanoids warp and twist to take vaguely elven features, and that elves themselves are immune to ghoul paralysis, are unusual side effects of this ancient source, yet today, ghouls are as likely to worship other vile gods\u00e2\u0080\u0094or simply eschew faith entirely\u00e2\u0080\u0094as they are to honor the first of their kind.\n Whispers in the WarrensLegend holds that Briganthor, a dwarf champion of Torag, quested to root out a pack of ghouls. After slaying the undead, he stumbled upon a tome of cannibalistic prayer-recipes. As Briganthor attempted to burn the book, the warren collapsed\u00e2\u0080\u0094trapping him and his brother. Desperate for sustenance, Briganthor searched the cave-in only to conclude there was no way out. As days melted into weeks, the paladin feared they would starve. That's when the whispers came.

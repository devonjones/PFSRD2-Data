They are both stronger and more violent, but their uncontrolled vision into possible futures has driven them beyond reason. They see every moment as a potential storm of uncontrollable fury, and out of a desperate desire for peace, quiet, and an end to their hunger, they lash out at all who come near. Wise creatures avoid great cyclopes at all cost.  \n  \n Debate has long raged over the origins of these massive, destructive giants. They are so large that it had long been assumed they were used as beasts of burden by their lesser kin, but they are now free to hunt and kill without restraint. Other scholars believe the great cyclops is the ultimate fate of the entire cyclops species. Whatever foolish decision or wayward curse caused the end of their civilization is still playing out, occasionally causing a cyclops to withdraw from its own kind, lose all semblance of intellect, and mutate into a lumbering, feral colossus. It is fortunate indeed that the great cyclops prefers to dwell far from humanoid settlements, because its immeasurable bloodlust inspires it to destroy virtually anything that moves, from dinosaurs and other monsters to the occasional explorer or soon-to-be-lost caravan.",

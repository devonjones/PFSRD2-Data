They know their history and value its integrity and privacy\u2014if younger ancestries like humanity aren\u2019t interested in learning from lizardfolk empires dating back to before the first human knocked two rocks together to make their first campfire, that\u2019s fine with them.  \n  \n The word \u201clizardfolk\u201d is an excellent example of humanity\u2019s narrow-sighted view of this culture. The name of their people is \u201ciruxi,\u201d but these reptilian humanoids have patiently and good-naturedly accepted the name \u201clizardfolk\u201d as a variant, and they generally resist urges to call humans and other mammalians similarly derivative names in return. Iruxis dwell and thrive in all tropical and temperate biomes, but they are most at home in swamplands, coastal regions, and riverlands, for they are talented swimmers, and fish and aquatic plants make up a large part of their preferred diets.",

This entry indicates how many Interact actions it takes to reload such weapons. This can be 0 if drawing ammunition and firing the weapon are part of the same action. If an item takes 2 or more actions to reload, the GM determines whether they must be performed together as an activity, or you can spend some of those actions during one turn and the rest during your next turn.  \n  \nAn item with an entry of \u201c\u2014\u201d must be drawn to be thrown, which usually takes an Interact action just like drawing any other weapon. Reloading a ranged weapon and drawing a thrown weapon both require a free hand. Switching your grip to free a hand and then to place your hands in the grip necessary to wield the weapon are both included in the actions you spend to reload a weapon.",

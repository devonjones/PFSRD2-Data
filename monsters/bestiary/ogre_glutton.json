Stories of ogre gluttons being tricked into eating razor-edged shields or barrels filled with poisoned meat are common, but such tales are of little consolation to those who have been gobbled down whole by these ravenous giants. In addition to their sadistic table manners, ogre gluttons have a disturbing knack for coming up with violent \u201cgames\u201d that are little more than drawn-out torments, yet those who somehow manage to beat a glutton at the rules of its own game can often enrage and frustrate the ogre enough that the resulting tantrum is more than enough distraction to afford a last-ditch escape from doom.",

Ogres are sadists that enjoy remorseless murder, torture, degradation, and mutilation in all of its forms. Although they prefer to vent their violent urges on smaller humanoids\u2014 the smaller and more beautiful, the better\u2014ogres promise a horrifying fate for anyone unlucky enough to fall within their meaty grasp. But for all their creativity in developing methods of violence, ogres often remain too dim-witted to realize that their playthings lack an ogre\u2019s robust fortitude and high pain tolerance, so most captives die far sooner than the ogres might prefer. Such a fate is perhaps preferable however, as those who survive too long as ogres\u2019 playthings suffer lasting mental scars from the horrifying abuse. A captive able to keep their wits can sometimes trick the brutes by promising treasure, meatier captives, or other crude amusements, taking advantage of an ogre\u2019s limited intellect to engineer opportunities to escape.  \n  \n Ogres are social creatures only in the most debased sense. They gather together in groups called families, though members are not always related by blood. Ogres practice incest regularly, believing that it makes for stronger familial bonds, and most ogres are misshapen or mutated from generations of inbreeding. The most powerful ogre in any family is the \u201cboss\u201d\u2014usually the family\u2019s patriarch or matriarch\u2014while other ogres in the family learn to obey or risk being brutalized by the boss\u2019s loyal kin. Ogres lair in caves, crumbling ruins, or dilapidated shacks close enough to humanoid settlements or animal trails to make raiding easy. These lairs are filthy and frequently contain all-too-recognizable evidence of their depravity.",

If a swallowed creature is of the maximum size listed, the monster can't use Swallow Whole again. If the creature is smaller than the maximum, the monster can usually swallow more creatures; the GM determines the maximum. The monster attempts an Athletics check opposed by the target's Reflex DC. If it succeeds, it swallows the creature. The monster's mouth or jaws no longer clutch a creature it has swallowed, so the monster is free to use them to Strike or Grab once again. The monster can't attack creatures it has swallowed.  \n  \n A swallowed creature is grabbed, is slowed 1, and has to hold its breath or start suffocating. The swallowed creature takes the listed amount of damage when first swallowed and at the end of each of its turns while it's swallowed. If the victim Escapes this ability's grabbed condition, it exits through the monster's mouth. This frees any other creature captured in the monster's mouth or jaws. A swallowed creature can attack the monster that has swallowed it, but only with unarmed attacks or with weapons of light Bulk or less. The swallowing creature is off-guard against the attack. If the monster takes piercing or slashing damage equaling or exceeding the listed Rupture value from a single attack or spell, the swallowed creature cuts itself free. A creature that gets free by either Escaping or cutting itself free can immediately breathe and exits the swallowing monster's space.  \n  \n If the monster dies, a swallowed creature can be freed by creatures adjacent to the corpse if they spend a combined total of 3 actions cutting the monster open with a weapon or unarmed attack that deals piercing or slashing damage.",

Few have ever seen a metallic dragon firsthand, but tales of their intervention in mortals\u2019 lives\u2014and of their passing\u2014always spread far and wide. Named for the way their scales resemble the shining metals humanoids use in commerce, warfare, and industry, these immense beings are diverse in their interests and abilities, and they don\u2019t seem to mind being associated with such mundane materials. After all, to compare a gold dragon to a gold coin is like comparing an ocean to a glass of water\u2014though they may seem similar at first glance, the raw power, breadth, and grandeur of one simply overwhelms the other.<br/><br/> In addition to metallic dragons and their chromatic counterparts (page 104\u2013115), other types of dragons roam the world and the rest of the multiverse. In the legendary lands of Tian Xia on the other side of the globe are the imperial dragons, serpentine beings who protect the cosmic balance and defend their ancient homeland. Outside the Material Plane, primal dragons such as the domineering brine dragon and reclusive cloud dragon shape the nature and goings-on of the Elemental Planes. Countless other types of dragons are sure to exist, including dragons on far-fiung planes of existence and, it is rumored, primeval dragons who soar between the stars. ",

Bronze dragons are abundant in Taldor, and many copper dragons lair in the wilds of Andoran, where they wage war alongside other freedom fighters to overthrow devils in the neighboring empire of Cheliax. Perhaps the most extreme example of a metallic dragon taking part in human affairs is on the island nation of Hermea, where Mengkare\u2014an ancient gold wyrm\u2014has begun a grand social experiment he calls \u201cthe Glorious Endeavor.\u201d Ostensibly intended to create a future utopia on Golarion, this highly controversial experiment is instead regarded by many as a cruel and unusual form of eugenics.\n",

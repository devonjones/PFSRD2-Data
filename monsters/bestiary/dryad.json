In times of peace, dryads happily live secluded lives inside their trees, and a community at harmony with nature might not even realize a dryad lives nearby.<br/><br/> Though they watch over all the woods around them, dryads are inextricably tied to a specific tree, usually an oak. Dryads who are bonded to another type of tree are fundamentally the same, but they may differ in temperament and appearance to match their ward.

A nymph queen\u2019s ward is a significant region, and she strengthens and vivifies this territory with her presence. Nymph queens are not dependent on their wards and lose the corresponding ability (such as a dryad\u2019s tree dependent ability); instead, they gain the tied to the land ability, as described below. A nymph queen also gains the nymph\u2019s beauty aura and the Focus Beauty action, which have varying effects based on the queen\u2019s original type. She gains the Inspiration ability, allowing her to bestow a gift of inspiration on those who catch her fancy, and the Change Shape ability to change her form. Finally, she gains primal prepared spells as a druid of her level.<br/><br/><b>Change Shape</b><img alt=\"Single Action\" class=\"actiondark\" src=\"Images\\Actions\\OneAction.png\" style=\"height:15px; padding:0px 2px 0px 2px\"/><img alt=\"Single Action\" class=\"actionlight\" src=\"Images\\Actions\\OneAction_I.png\" style=\"height:15px; padding:0px 2px 0px 2px\"/> (<a aonid=\"127\" game-obj=\"Traits\">polymorph</a>, <a aonid=\"134\" game-obj=\"Traits\">primal</a>, <a aonid=\"157\" game-obj=\"Traits\">transmutation</a>) Nymph queens can transform between their original form, which looks much like a typical nymph of their kind, and any Small or Medium humanoid form, typically choosing a more humanoid-looking version of their natural form.<br/><b>Focus Beauty</b><img alt=\"Single Action\" class=\"actiondark\" src=\"Images\\Actions\\OneAction.png\" style=\"height:15px; padding:0px 2px 0px 2px\"/><img alt=\"Single Action\" class=\"actionlight\" src=\"Images\\Actions\\OneAction_I.png\" style=\"height:15px; padding:0px 2px 0px 2px\"/> (<a aonid=\"60\" game-obj=\"Traits\">emotion</a>, <a aonid=\"61\" game-obj=\"Traits\">enchantment</a>, <a aonid=\"106\" game-obj=\"Traits\">mental</a>, <a aonid=\"134\" game-obj=\"Traits\">primal</a>, <a aonid=\"163\" game-obj=\"Traits\">visual</a>) The nymph queen focuses her beauty upon a target within her aura. The creature must attempt a Will save. On a failure, it is affected as if by the nymph queen\u2019s nymph\u2019s beauty aura; if it was already affected by the aura, it suffers a greater effect described in the nymph queen\u2019s entry. A nymph queen can Focus Beauty on a given creature only once per turn.<br/><b>Inspiration</b><img alt=\"Three Actions\" class=\"actiondark\" src=\"Images\\Actions\\ThreeActions.png\" style=\"height:15px; padding:0px 2px 0px 2px\"/><img alt=\"Three Actions\" class=\"actionlight\" src=\"Images\\Actions\\ThreeActions_I.png\" style=\"height:15px; padding:0px 2px 0px 2px\"/> (<a aonid=\"60\" game-obj=\"Traits\">emotion</a>, <a aonid=\"61\" game-obj=\"Traits\">enchantment</a>, <a aonid=\"106\" game-obj=\"Traits\">mental</a>, <a aonid=\"134\" game-obj=\"Traits\">primal</a>) A nymph queen can inspire a single intelligent creature by giving that creature a token of her favor, typically a lock of her hair. As long as the creature carries her token and remains in good standing with the nymph queen, the creature gains a +1 status bonus to all Crafting checks, Performance checks, and Will saves.<br/> If a nymph queen grants her Inspiration to a bard and the nymph queen is that bard\u2019s muse, the bard gains an additional benefit depending on their muse theme: for lore muse, the bard also gains a +1 status bonus to all Lore checks; for maestro muse, the status bonus to Performance checks increases to +2 for the purpose of determining the effects of compositions; for polymath muse, the bard gains a +4 status bonus to untrained skill checks; and for all other muses, the Will save bonus increases to +2 against fey.<br/><b>Nymph\u2019s Beauty</b> (<a aonid=\"206\" game-obj=\"Traits\">aura</a>, <a aonid=\"60\" game-obj=\"Traits\">emotion</a>, <a aonid=\"61\" game-obj=\"Traits\">enchantment</a>, <a aonid=\"106\" game-obj=\"Traits\">mental</a>, <a aonid=\"134\" game-obj=\"Traits\">primal</a>, <a aonid=\"163\" game-obj=\"Traits\">visual</a>) 30 feet. Creatures that start their turn in the aura must succeed at a Will save or suffer an effect described in the nymph queen\u2019s entry.<br/><b>Tied to the Land</b> A nymph queen is intrinsically tied to a specific region, such as a forest for a dryad queen. As long as the queen is healthy, the environment is exceptionally resilient, allowing the nymph queen to automatically attempt to counteract spells and rituals such as blight that would harm the environment, using her Spell DC with a counteract level equal to the highest-level druid spell she can cast. When the nymph queen becomes physically or psychologically unhealthy, however, her warded region eventually becomes twisted or unhealthy as well. In that case, restoring the nymph queen swiftly heals the entire region.",

When they aren\u2019t sleeping or stalking prey, giant frilled lizards bask in the sunlight for hours at a time. Explorers sometimes mistakenly think them related to dragons due to their large size, elaborate neck frills (which, when displayed in a show of aggression and dominance, can be mistaken for wings), and ferocious hissing vocalizations used to frighten away creatures too large to eat.  \n  \n A giant frilled lizard\u2019s primary food sources are oversized arthropods and other invertebrates, but it won\u2019t hesitate to augment its diet with vertebrates, including other lizards, monkeys, and just about anything it can flt into its mouth\u2014even humanoids. Although capable of short bursts of speed, a giant frilled lizard normally lies perfectly still while hunting, hoping to ambush its prey.",

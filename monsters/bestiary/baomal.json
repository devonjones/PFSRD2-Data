In the case of the baomal, extensive research suggests that neither of these explanations are accurate. No ancient texts have yet been recovered in which a wizard claims to have created the first baomal. And while the alghollthu of today use them as warbeasts, ancient carvings suggest that in the earliest days, baomals were ravenous hunters of alghollthus.",

Near the surface, baomals that encounter ships quickly learn that they contain a variety of tasty morsels. The creatures use their devastating spikes to rip open the ships\u2019 hulls, then leisurely feed on the helpless sailors.",

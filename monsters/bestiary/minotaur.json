Great-horned minotaurs can impale foes if they critically succeed on a charge, but they do not have the Hunted Fear ability. Shaggy minotaurs are covered in thick hair form head to toe, allowing them to live in freezing environments with ease and giving them resistance to cold damage, but their hooves are broad and heavy, making it impossible for them to charge.",

These monstrous tormentors delight in the hunt, in the terror caused by closing in on prey, and in the very moment when the hunted realizes that they have lost the game. Only then will the minotaur charge in for the kill, cutting foes down with powerful strikes or impaling them on its sharp horns.  \n  \n Minotaurs are known to dwell in mazes, but they can also be found hiding in old ruins and other forgotten corners of the world. In any case, they are solitary creatures, only rarely sharing territory with others of their kind or even more powerful beings that have cowed them into service. Everyone else is little more than prey to be hunted.",

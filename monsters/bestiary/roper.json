Cunning and patient ambush predators, ropers use this to their advantage.  \n  \n Ropers do not form large societies (although they can often be found living alongside other deep-dwelling denizens), but they often congregate in small clusters and sometimes hunt in groups. Particularly interested in the philosophy of life and death and the flner points of the more cruel and sinister religions of the world, a roper can talk or argue for hours with those it initially sought merely to eat. Quick-thinking spelunkers can sometimes stave off a roper\u2019s appetite by entertaining it with stories or discussions of philosophy, but ropers do not willingly allow such intriguing prey to escape alive. Stories speak of particularly skilled debaters and philosophers who have been kept for days or even years as pets or conversational companions by roper clusters, but in the end, if such pets don\u2019t eventually escape, the ropers\u2019 appetites win out over their intellectual curiosity\u2014especially in cases where the pets constantly outmaneuver their keepers\u2019 wits and patience. A roper is 9 feet tall and weighs 2,200 pounds.",

Each additional hit from a strand increases the enfeebled condition value by 1 (to a maximum of enfeebled 4). This enfeebled value decreases by 1 every 8 hours. The roper can move while it has a creature grabbed with a strand, but it automatically releases the creature if it moves beyond the strand\u2019s reach. The roper can release an grabbed creature as a free action. A creature can sever a strand with a target attack that hits AC 27 and deals at least 18 slashing damage. This doesn\u2019t deal any damage to the roper itself, though it can no longer attack with a severed strand."

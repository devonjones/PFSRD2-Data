The creature\u2019s familiar batlike anatomy and predilection for caverns suggests an evolution in the Darklands, but its ability to dip in and out of its own personal extradimensional space is far from typical for purely subterranean creatures. Further complicating all of this is the deculi\u2019s infrared vision, which anatomists agree is completely unheard of in mammalian species on Golarion. The most credible theories suggest that the deculi is not from Golarion at all, but arrived here long ago from some part of the Material Plane beyond the reckoning of most mortals.",

To non-deculis, the extradimensional space looks like an ordinary area of darkness (though effects such as *true seeing* can see through this illusion). The deculi\u2019s infrared vision functions normally between this extradimensional space and the area outside its confines, allowing the deculi to sense what is going on around it, and its innate *darkness* spell also extends to the area around the shadow sanctuary. Attacks cannot be made into or from the extradimensional space.  \n The deculi can Dismiss this effect to emerge from its shadow sanctuary, but the space it emerges into must be in darkness and must be unobstructed. If the area is obstructed, the deculi is shunted to the nearest available space and takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage per 5 feet shunted. If the area overlaying the shadow sanctuary becomes illuminated by magical light, the extradimensional space can no longer be accessed and the deculi is trapped within until the area is once again in darkness. The deculi can try to extinguish a magical light effect obscuring its sanctuary once per day by attempting to counteract the light effect with its *darkness* innate spell.  \n If a deculi dies (including from hunger, thirst, or asphyxiation) while within the extradimensional space, the shadow sanctuary immediately ends and the deculi\u2019s corpse is expelled. If the area is illuminated, the corpse is not expelled until the sanctuary entrance is in darkness once again."

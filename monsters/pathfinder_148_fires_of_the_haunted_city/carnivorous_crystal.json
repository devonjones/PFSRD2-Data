Their preferred method is by infecting their victims with magical enzymes that cause living flesh to rapidly petrify and transform into immobile crystal. At the end of this process, the crystallized victim shatters as a newly born carnivorous crystal emerges from its cocoon. Like other oozes, however, they are also capable of reproducing by splitting, though they typically do so only under extreme duress.",

Any creature of the monster\u2019s size or smaller whose space the monster moves through can attempt a Reflex save with the listed DC to avoid being engulfed. A creature unable to act automatically critically fails this save. If a creature succeeds at its save, it can choose to be either pushed aside (out of the monster\u2019s path) or pushed in front of the monster to the end of the monster\u2019s movement. The monster can attempt to Engulf the same creature only once in a single use of Engulf. The monster can contain as many creatures as can fit in its space.  \n  \n A creature that fails its save is pulled into the monster\u2019s body. It is grabbed, is slowed 1, and has to hold its breath or start suffocating. The creature takes the listed amount of damage when first engulfed and at the end of each of its turns while it\u2019s engulfed. An engulfed creature can get free by Escaping against the listed escape DC. An engulfed creature can attack the monster engulfing it, but only with unarmed attacks or with weapons of light Bulk or less. The engulfing creature is flat-footed against the attack. If the monster takes piercing or slashing damage equaling or exceeding the listed Rupture value from a single attack or spell, the engulfed creature cuts itself free. A creature that gets free by either method can immediately breathe and exits the swallowing monster\u2019s space.  \n  \n If the monster dies, all creatures it has engulfed are automatically released as the monster\u2019s form loses cohesion.",

Their preferred method is by infecting their victims with magical enzymes that cause living flesh to rapidly petrify and transform into immobile crystal. At the end of this process, the crystallized victim shatters as a newly born carnivorous crystal emerges from its cocoon. Like other oozes, however, they are also capable of reproducing by splitting, though they typically do so only under extreme duress.",

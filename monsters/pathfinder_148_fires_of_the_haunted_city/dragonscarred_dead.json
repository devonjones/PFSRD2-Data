These undead guardians are infused with a fraction of the power of the dragon who slew them, channeling the same energy as their draconic masters\u2019 breath.  \n  \n Dragonscarred dead are similar to skeletal champions or graveknights in that they are not merely reanimated servants who mindlessly follow orders, but are instead powerful wardens who maintain the same agency they bore in life. While a dragonscarred dead is often magically compelled to follow its reanimator\u2019s commands, some of these undead dragonslayers manage to escape their masters and pursue their own vile agendas\u2014which may involve rallying allies to challenge their draconic creator once more and finish the dire mission they started in life.",

This attack has the finesse trait.  \n **Drain Soul Cage** [-] **Frequency** once per day; **Effect** The lich taps into their soul cage's power to cast any arcane spell up to the highest rank the lich can cast, even if the spell being cast is not one of the lich's prepared spells. The lich's soul cage doesn't need to be present for the lich to use this ability.  \n **Siphon Life** A lich's form draws forth life from those who come into contact with it. When the lich damages a living creature with an unarmed attack, the lich gains 5 temporary Hit Points and the creature must succeed at a Fortitude save against the lich's spell DC \u2013 2 or become drained 1. If the lich is grabbed or restrained at the start of its turn, each creature grabbing or restraining it must succeed at a Fortitude save or become drained 1. If the lich siphons a creature's life again, the drained value increase by 1, to a maximum of drained 4.",

First, a lich requires solitude to plan their elaborate schemes, and second, few mortals (if any) deign to interact with these legendarily corrupt necromancers. One reason begets the other, as a lich's self-imposed isolation often drives them toward detachment and disdain for mortal life, further solidifying their separation from civilization. The longer a lich lives, the more meticulous a planner they become, secreting themself within a labyrinth of deadly puzzles, misdirection, and monsters. A lich's servants and guardians are absolutely loyal, either due to their nature (such as constructs or other undead) or as a result of compulsion from powerful magic. Many liches sink into their own warped worldviews; the nature of a lich's lair is a good indicator of their outlook on life itself.",

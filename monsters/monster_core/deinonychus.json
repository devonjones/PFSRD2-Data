They are lean, muscular, and have two powerful legs and a long tail that helps them maintain balance. Although deinonychuses don't use their dexterous clawed forelimbs to attack, the dinosaurs can use them to pull aside small barriers. Although some of these dinosaurs have scaly skin, most have thatches of vibrantly colored feathers as well. A deinonychus is about 6 feet tall and weighs about 150 pounds.",

The largest and most dangerous dinosaurs, such as the tyrannosaurus, are generally avoided, although more powerful creatures like giants have been known to be able to keep them as pets, guardians, or even brutal executioners. In more bloodthirsty cultures, dinosaurs are sadly sometimes used as combatants in gladiatorial battles.",

            "text": "Remnants from the world's primeval era, these enormous reptilian animals still exist in large numbers in remote wildernesses or underground in magical Darklands caverns. Lizardfolk, orcs, giants, and other humanoids who live near dinosaurs use the animals as mounts, guards, or hunting beasts. Occasionally, rich nobles will collect dinosaurs to display them in menageries, which almost inevitably leads to cast-offs being nursed back to health by druids and other champions of nature. When dinosaurs establish themselves in regions outside their normal habitats, it's often the result of a large collection being released.",

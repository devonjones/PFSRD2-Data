They seek the death of every mortal being by the most painful and horrible means possible, in service to the Apocalypse Riders. Each kind of daemon represents a different way to die, and their powers are nearly always aimed at spreading that particular form of death. Through the use of these powers, they seek to drag all existence down into a pit of hopelessness and despair, and to commit all souls to oblivion.  \n  \n While mortals who summon daemons usually seek to use the creatures' destructive and corrupting powers for their own ends, daemons always look for ways to spread fear, doubt, and despair wherever they go. Often, daemons disguise their plots as the workings of other fiends, knowing that such confusion compounds mortals' fear and keeps those mortals from bringing the most effective weapons. As a result, learned mortals sometimes refer to daemons as \u201criders\u201d after their leaders or \u201csoul mongers\u201d after their largest industry.  \n  \n While many fiends seek to tempt mortals into lives of nihilistic evil to increase their own numbers and power on their native planes, daemons are further driven by a supernatural hunger for mortal souls and use a variety of methods\u2014not least of which is the cacodaemons' soul gems\u2014to entrap them. On Abaddon and in other forbidding places across the multiverse, souls are simultaneously a delicacy, a trade good, and a source of magical power, and the daemons are among the greatest gluttons, merchants, and abusers of this spiritual \u201cresource.\u201d",

When they do, the cacodaemon grows a fist-sized soul gem (Hardness 2, HP 8) in their gut and can regurgitate it at any time as an Interact action. Destroying the gem frees the soul within but doesn't return the deceased creature to life. If a caster attempts to return to life a creature whose soul is trapped within a soul gem, they fail unless they succeed at a DC 30 Religion check. A success causes the soul gem to shatter so the creature is returned to life as normal for the spell.  \n A fiend can Interact to ingest a soul gem it is holding, condemning the soul to the fiend's home plane. The fiend gains fast healing 5 for 1 minute."

Although quick to bend their knees to higher-ranking devils and even mortals favored by Asmodeus, vordines are relentlessly cruel to orts and other devils they can call their subordinates.  \n  \n Although higher ranks in the infernal military are held by more powerful devils, like the nessari who serve as generals, a labyrinthine structure gives each vordine a rank and certain responsibilities. Some vordines are responsible for the battlefield command of squads, while others relay orders from above or are set to handling specific administrative tasks for their unit. The greatest gift one can offer a vordine is an increased rank to lord over other vordines.",

Those who succumb to these temptations find themselves consigned to an afterlife of endless torment in the pits of Hell, wherein the only hope of escape lies in the chance of being promoted to become a devil in the infernal ranks.  \n  \n Every devil has a specific role to play in the upkeep of the remorseless bureaucratic machine that is Hell, from soldiers and scholars to inquisitors, lawyers, judges, and executioners. Lowly orts perform subservient labor to more powerful and specialized devils, such as infantry and contract devils, while the greatest nessaris command entire infernal armies.  \n  \nAsmodeus stands at the apex of the structure he created, but the layers below him are marked by a constant jockeying for position. Most diabolic plans ultimately serve to improve the schemer's place in the hierarchy.",

To ensure they do not bolster their foe's ranks, they enact horrific transformations on their targets, converting their victims into beings incapable of discerning right from wrong; this renders them unable to be judged by Pharasma's courts and thus incapable of becoming fiends.

Unless otherwise noted, the battle form prevents you from casting spells, speaking, and using most manipulate actions that require hands.

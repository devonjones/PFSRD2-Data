The cythnigot's most identifying feature is the long stalk of fungal material that extends from creature's body, ending in a surprisingly strong set of fanged jaws.",

To ensure they do not bolster their foe's ranks, they enact horrific transformations on their targets, converting their victims into beings incapable of discerning right from wrong; this renders them unable to be judged by Pharasma's courts and thus incapable of becoming fiends.

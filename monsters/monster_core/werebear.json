            "text": "Unwavering conviction fills a werebear during their transformations. This can drive them zealously into noble causes, but it can also make them ruthless, violent, and single-minded. Alliances can fall from a werebear's mind as their bestial temper overcomes them and their goal overwhelms all. As a result, werebears are loners, rarely even living together as families longer than necessary. As long as there is nothing around to threaten it or the natural area it protects (typically a forest), a werebear in its animal form is generally content to forage and sleep away the night.",

These changes reflect a werecreature in its hybrid form.  \n  \n Increase the creature's level by 1 and change its statistics as follows. \n* It gains the beast and werecreature traits.\n* Increase its size by one category if the animal is a larger size than the base humanoid.\n* Increase its AC, attack bonuses, DCs, saving throws, and skill modifiers by 1.\n* Increase its damage with Strikes and other offensive abilities by 1. If the werecreature is limited in how often it can use an ability (such as magical breath), increase the damage by 2 instead.\n* Increase its HP by the amount shown on the table. This HP increase is more than typical in order to compensate for the creature's weakness to silver.\n* The creature gains weakness to silver as shown on the table.\n \n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| **Starting Level** | **HP Increase** | **Weakness to Silver** |\n| 4 or lower  | +25  | 5 |\n| 5\u20137  | +35  | 7 |\n| 8\u201314  | +50  | 10 |\n| 15+  | +75  | 15 |",

You might also need to adjust some abilities that conflict with the theme of the werecreature.  \n  \n **Senses** The werecreature gains all the senses of the animal.  \n **Animal Empathy** The werecreature can ask questions of, receive answers from, and use the Diplomacy skill with animals of its general kind.  \n **Claws** The werecreature gains a claw Strike (an agile unarmed attack that deals slashing damage). If it had any agile attacks, the damage dealt by its claws should be roughly the same as the damage dealt by those attacks. If it had only non-agile attacks, its claws should deal three-quarters that damage.  \n **Jaws** The creature gains a jaws Strike (an unarmed attack that deals piercing damage) that inflicts its curse of the werecreature. If it had any non-agile attacks, the damage dealt by its jaws should be roughly the same as the damage dealt by those attacks. If it had only agile attacks, its jaws should deal one-third more damage.  \n **Change Shape** [#] (concentrate, polymorph, primal) The werecreature changes into its humanoid, hybrid, or animal shape. Each shape has a specific, persistent appearance. A true werecreature's natural form is its hybrid shape. In humanoid shape, the werecreature uses its original humanoid size, loses its jaws and claws Strikes, and gains a melee fist Strike that deals bludgeoning damage equal to the slashing damage dealt by its claw. In animal shape, its Speed and size change to that of the animal, it gains any special Strike effects of the animal that it didn't already have (such as Grab), and it loses its weapon Strikes.  \n **Curse of the Werecreature** (curse, primal) This curse affects only humanoids; **Saving Throw** Fortitude DC is the moderate spell DC for the werecreature's new level. On each full moon, the cursed creature must succeed at another Fortitude save or turn into the same kind of werecreature until dawn. The creature is under the GM's control and goes on a rampage for half the night before falling unconscious until dawn.  \n **Moon Frenzy** (polymorph, primal) When a full moon appears in the night sky, the werecreature must enter hybrid form, can't Change Shape thereafter, becomes one size larger, increases its reach by 5 feet, and increases the damage of its jaws by 2. When the moon sets or the sun rises, the werecreature returns to humanoid form and is fatigued for 2d4 hours.",

If it comes under the effect of a second polymorph effect, the second polymorph effect attempts to counteract the first. If it succeeds, it takes effect, and if it fails, the spell has no effect on that target. Any Strikes specifically granted by a polymorph effect are magical. Unless otherwise stated, polymorph spells don't allow the target to take on the appearance of a specific individual creature, but rather just a generic creature of a general type or ancestry.  \n  \n If you take on a battle form with a polymorph spell, the special statistics can be adjusted only by circumstance bonuses, status bonuses, and penalties. Unless otherwise noted, the battle form prevents you from casting spells, speaking, and using most manipulate actions that require hands. (If there's doubt about whether you can use an action, the GM decides.) Your gear is absorbed into you; the constant abilities of your gear still function, but you can't activate any items. If a polymorph effect causes you to increase in size, you must have space to expand into or the effect is disrupted.",

If it comes under the effect of a second polymorph effect, the second polymorph effect attempts to counteract the first. If it succeeds, it takes effect, and if it fails, the spell has no effect on that target. Any Strikes specifically granted by a polymorph effect are magical. Unless otherwise stated, polymorph spells don't allow the target to take on the appearance of a specific individual creature, but rather just a generic creature of a general type or ancestry.  \n  \n If you take on a battle form with a polymorph spell, the special statistics can be adjusted only by circumstance bonuses, status bonuses, and penalties. Unless otherwise noted, the battle form prevents you from casting spells, speaking, and using most manipulate actions that require hands. (If there's doubt about whether you can use an action, the GM decides.) Your gear is absorbed into you; the constant abilities of your gear still function, but you can't activate any items.",

Unless otherwise noted, the battle form prevents you from casting spells, speaking, and using most manipulate actions that require hands.

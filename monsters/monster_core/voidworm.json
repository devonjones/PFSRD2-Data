To call a voidworm a protean in the presence of a more powerful protean is a sure a way to instigate combat.  \n  \n Voidworms themselves have little interest in whether anyone sees them as proteans. They maintain a thriving ecology in the Maelstrom, frolicking in schools of up to 20 and playing in the chaos of constantly shifting realities. Elsewhere (such as in the Universe), voidworms are mesmerized by the principle of object permanence; many latch onto specific features of a region (such as a hillside or pond) and flit through the air around it for months or even years as they wait for the object of their curiosity to change. Minor changes\u2014such as a tree's change of color in the fall, a corpse's slow decay, or periodic venting of steam from a geyser\u2014all fascinate voidworms. A voidworm is about 2 feet long and weighs 2 pounds.",

Scholars have long been intrigued by this fact\u2014that scions of dissolution and disorder would share so many features\u2014pointing out that there is some semblance of order even in the purest chaos. Others note that the serpentine form is one of the most primeval shapes, perhaps suggesting that in a reality at the dawn of time, such shapes were all that could exist. The proteans themselves have little to say on the matter, which, perhaps ironically, only adds to the confusion and lack of consensus surrounding their kind.

Unless otherwise stated, polymorph spells don't allow the target to take on the appearance of a specific individual creature, but rather just a generic creature of a general type or ancestry.  \n  \n If you take on a battle form with a polymorph spell, the special statistics can be adjusted only by circumstance bonuses, status bonuses, and penalties. Unless otherwise noted, the battle form prevents you from casting spells, speaking, and using most manipulate actions that require hands. (If there's doubt about whether you can use an action, the GM decides.) Your gear is absorbed into you; the constant abilities of your gear still function, but you can't activate any items.",

            "text": "The burning-winged coartis are marked by the onerous contracts they agreed to and bound to Hell by the machinations of a legalistic devil, usually a phistophilus. Some coartis are truly a type of fallen celestial, those trapped in horrible agreements for the greater good or due to grievous errors in judgment, but most arise from mortal souls that were on the path to become celestials yet were contractually bound to Hell. Coartis serve in public roles as messengers and personal attendants to demonstrate the power of Hell and the legal acumen of their corruptors.  \n  \n Celestials universally pity coartis and despise their creators, but their preferred methods of dealing with the corrupted beings differ. While angels argue against lost cases in Pharasma's courts, seeking loopholes in the voluminous contracts, azatas scheme daring heists against the contract storehouses. Archons are the most direct, working to end their blighted lives.",

Those who succumb to these temptations find themselves consigned to an afterlife of endless torment in the pits of Hell, wherein the only hope of escape lies in the chance of being promoted to become a devil in the infernal ranks.  \n  \n Every devil has a specific role to play in the upkeep of the remorseless bureaucratic machine that is Hell, from soldiers and scholars to inquisitors, lawyers, judges, and executioners. Lowly orts perform subservient labor to more powerful and specialized devils, such as infantry and contract devils, while the greatest nessaris command entire infernal armies.  \n  \nAsmodeus stands at the apex of the structure he created, but the layers below him are marked by a constant jockeying for position. Most diabolic plans ultimately serve to improve the schemer's place in the hierarchy.",

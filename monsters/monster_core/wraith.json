Their shadowy forms are covered by insubstantial robes that they wear like a badge of office and marked with peering eyes that reflect their judgment of the living. A wraith can be created by foul magic or direct exposure to the Void, but more often they are the result of death on a tragic scale. When a tragedy is too great for even reality to witness, a temporary manifestation of the Void can leave behind countless wraiths in a horde of darkness. A wraith's existence is one of emptiness and need, with a desire to call others to the same emptiness exemplified by the Void.  \n  \n Wraiths can haunt any location where they can safely interact with the living, looking for those worthy to become new wraiths and disposing of the rest, though their vulnerability to sunlight confines them to the shadowy places of the world\u2014places where they can blend in seamlessly with their dark surroundings before silently engulfing their prey. Wraiths' opinions on who is worthy vary, but they typically choose those closest to the Void already, whether from a metaphysical connection or exposure to countless deaths. A new wraith created this way carries these aspects, with the rest of their personality warped or scoured away by exposure to the Void.  \n  \n Wraiths gather with others of their kind in places where death and mayhem are commonplace\u2014countrysides ravaged by war, metropolitan underworlds run by criminal overlords, or sites of fiendish rituals. In these places, the living do well to keep to the light. Wraiths are smart enough to take advantage of their incorporeality in combat, so they keep to tortuous caverns or structures with hallways, and avoid open areas.",

Their shadowy, incorporeal forms are dotted with burning eyes that reflect their hatred for the living, and shadowy claws are weapon enough to steal the vitality from their enemies. A wraith may be created by foul necromancy, but more often they are the result of a hermitic murderer or mutilator who even in death could not give up their wicked ways.

In these places, the living do well to tread with sunrods and powerful clerics in tow.

Wraiths are smart enough to take advantage of their incorporeality in combat, so they keep to tortuous caverns or structures with hallways and avoid open areas.  \n  \n As they're formed purely of anti-life from the Negative Energy Plane, wraiths pervade that unholy realm. Within nations and civilizations ruled by the undead, wraiths have places of power as assassins and spies. They're among the ruling class in Geb, but have greater numbers in Ustalav, where packs of wraiths roam graveyards and misty trails, consuming the populations of entire villages. In other parts of the world, wraiths tend not to wander and limit their activity to smaller environs, typically just the site of their chosen haunting and its immediate surroundings.",

Their physical manifestation is a constant state of flux between these two extremes; their forms are draped in a hooded, shifting cloak of night black where galaxies and other celestial objects flit in and out of existence at every moment, as if depicting the constant life, death, and rebirth of a miniature, self-contained universe.  \n  \n Pleromas see the multiverse as both eternal and cyclical, doomed and malleable, ending only if these cycles ever become unbalanced. They believe the current Convergence is necessary to obtain this essential balance, and act to ensure that the grand design of the Monad is carried out to the smallest detail.",

Each type of aeon takes on some form of duality in its manifestation and works either to shape the multiverse within the aspects of this duality in some way, or to correct imbalances to the perfect order of existence. Aeons' machinations can raise a nation, raze it, or restore it from ruin. Their reasons are their own, and they rarely share their motivations with others\u2014through their strange envisioning mode of communication, they simply create the results they insist are necessary to maintain the balance of the multiverse.  \n  \n As a result of recent shifts in reality, aeons have begun to reassert a presence in the perfect planar city of Axis. To aeons, this is merely the latest in a recurring cycle, albeit one that mortals have not yet borne witness to. Aeons have a name for this cyclic return, in which they welcome their industrious axiomite brethren back to their fold: the Convergence. At the onset of the Convergence, a council of pleroma aeons appeared in the Eternal City of Axis, where they revealed that axiomites were wayward aeons, split off long ago to pursue the act of creation. With the latest cycle of change, it was time for axiomites\u2014and their mortal creations and kin\u2014to rejoin the aeon cause. While most axiomites fell in line, realizing perhaps on a fundamental level of reality that what the aeons said was the truth, some refused to heed the call and waited for the wrath of the aeons. That wrath has yet to come. The dual-natured aeons have responded to those who have declined in confusing ways. With some they treat and even bargain, while a handful of others they have destroyed, and a few have been exterminated by the axiomites. But most of these quiet insurgents they leave alone, allowing these axiomites to continue to create in peace. How\u2014or if\u2014this Convergence will end is as little understood as aeons themselves.",

In the strongest areas of a vitality plane, they could take moderate or even major vitality damage instead. While this might seem safe for living creatures, vitality planes present a different danger. Living creatures regain an amount of HP each round equal to the environmental damage undead take in the same area. If this would bring the living creature above their maximum HP, any excess becomes temporary HP. Unlike normal, these temporary HP combine with each other, and they last until the creature leaves the plane. If a creature\u2019s temporary HP from a vitality plane ever exceeds its maximum HP, it explodes in a burst of overloaded vitality energy, spreading across the area to birth new souls.",

Phantoms gain immunity to bleed, disease, paralyzed, poison, and precision damage and resistance to all damage (except force, *ghost touch*, or spirit; double resistance vs. non-magical) from being incorporeal. Many phantoms gain occult innate spells or special powers related to the Ethereal Plane, such as those described in the stat blocks on these pages.

When a mortal dies, their soul enters the River of Souls and eventually reaches the Boneyard, where it is judged by Pharasma. The judged soul moves onto its appropriate domain of final rest\u2014 Heaven, Hell, Abaddon, and so forth\u2014where it becomes a shade.  \n  \n Complications arise, however, when a soul in queue for judgment prematurely departs from the River of Souls and is shunted into the Ethereal Plane. Whether as a result of nefarious interlopers like daemons or hags, malignant planar magic, or even fate, these souls become dislodged from the natural order of life and death and linger in a sort of purgatory. Unlike petitioners, these ethereal phantoms retain memories of their life before death, and unlike spirits such as ghosts, phantoms aren't tinged with the foul influences of undeath\u2014at least, not at first, though the threat of corruption hangs heavy over a phantom's existence. Some eventually succumb to that fate, while others eventually rejoin the River of Souls. Until then, these wandering souls are a kind unto themselves\u2014one without a true home, agenda, or purpose.  \n  \n Many phantoms have no desire to remain in their strange state of purgatory, either because they seek to continue their journey through the River of Souls or because they fear the corruption of undeath. In order to complete the natural spiritual cycle and become judged so they can continue to the afterlife, a phantom must find a way back into the River of Souls. Such a quest is no easy feat, however\u2014the hazy mists of the Ethereal Plane can befuddle even the most experienced traveler, and numerous predators prowl the realm in search of stray souls to bind or devour.",

When inside an object, an incorporeal creature can\u2019t perceive, attack, or interact with anything outside the object, and if it starts its turn in an object, it\u2019s slowed 1 until the end of its turn. A corporeal and an incorporeal creature can pass through one another, but they can\u2019t end their movement in each other\u2019s space.  \n  \nAn incorporeal creature can\u2019t attempt Strength-based checks against physical creatures or objects\u2014only against incorporeal ones\u2014unless those objects have the ghost touch property rune. Likewise, a corporeal creature can\u2019t attempt Strength-based checks against incorporeal creatures or objects.  \n  \nIncorporeal creatures usually have immunity to effects or conditions that require a physical body, like disease, poison, and precision damage. They usually have resistance against all damage (except force damage and damage from Strikes with the _ghost touch_ property rune), with double the resistance against non-magical damage.",

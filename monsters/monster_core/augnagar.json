But to them, the greatest delicacy is the flesh of other augnagars. Augnagars have swollen, spiderlike legs with leathery membranes like a bat's wings, and three tails ending in hooked stings perfect for slicing flesh.  \n  \n An augnagar that gorges sufficiently, especially on other augnagars, can grow so massive it can't even move, thrashing and festering where it lies. It eventually flies into a frenzy of self-cannibalism as it rips apart its own flesh to feast on. From the ruinous remains emerges a thulgant\u2014a smaller but more powerful qlippoth.",

To ensure they do not bolster their foe's ranks, they enact horrific transformations on their targets, converting their victims into beings incapable of discerning right from wrong; this renders them unable to be judged by Pharasma's courts and thus incapable of becoming fiends.

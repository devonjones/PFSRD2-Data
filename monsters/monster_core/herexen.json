If the weapon is simple, increase the damage die by one step; if it's two-handed, decrease the herexen's attack bonus with that weapon by 2.\n* Swap out the herexen's domain spell for a 1st-rank focus spell from a domain associated with that deity.\n* Swap the defiled religious symbol for the correct deity.

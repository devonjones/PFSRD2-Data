However, Avathrael is also a cruel, unsavory ally. All those who enter Gloaming Arbor are trapped inside, and the shadows comprising their realm warp all living creatures within it. While Avathrael does use these shadows to alter their land and realm, they don't usually mutate their subjects intentionally; the plane itself does so. Regardless, Avathrael is a tyrant, and the PCs will need to choose either to ally with them or to betray them and ally with another. Depending on the PCs' choices, they might fight Avathrael, who'll likely be supported by Unaasi and other agents of the Wildwood Lodge.  \n  \n***Recall Knowledge - Dragon* (*Arcana*)**: DC 40  \n***Recall Knowledge - Plant* (*Nature*)**: DC 40  \n***Unspecific Lore***: DC 38  \n***Specific Lore***: DC 35",

            "text": "Avathrael Realmshaper is a vain and curious dragon. As much plant as dragon, they always had a fondness for gardening and the cultivation of life. A chance encounter with a planar portal to the First World awakened something within Avathrael: a thirst for answers and curiosity for what lay beyond. It was pondering these many \u201cbeyonds\u201d that drove Avathrael to study planar cosmology and, in time, the use of planar magic.  \n  \n Avathrael established a small territory within the Verduran Forest, where they practiced this magic on themself and the forest around them. Their territory became a place of whimsical wonders and strange creations, for at their heart, Avathrael remained interested in cultivation and creation. To further their goals, Avathrael attempted to open a portal to Nirvana to channel its beauty into their realm. The attempt backfired, instead conjuring part of the Netherworld. This planar inundation overtook Avathrael's realm, warping all the creatures, plants, and land within, including Avathrael. Some say the shadows corrupted Avathrael, but the Realmshaper would say the shadows perfected them. Gone was Avathrael's whimsy and kindness. Gone was their weakness and frivolity. Yet, Avathrael's curiosity remained. They became a scientist and scholar, an artist and architect, performing countless experiments on the planar shadows now so abundant within their realm, and learned how to craft magnificent wonders within it.  \n  \n The shadows shaped them. The once colorful, vibrant garden of flowers that grew upon their back and wings became a testing ground for creating poisonous flora. Their pristine scales became coated in malleable shadows. In time, Avathrael learned to harness the shadows, shaping their body purposefully into new forms\u2014shadow claws, additional limbs, razor blades lining their tail\u2014their form was now theirs to choose.  \n  \n Centuries have passed since Avathrael became the Realmshaper and their territory became Gloaming Arbor, and Avathrael has become an expert in rituals and planar magic. They've pulled on the malleable shadows within their realm, shaping and molding it like a potter does clay, until their realm became something utterly unique\u2014both a part of and separate from reality. They're incredibly territorial and don't allow trespassers or inhabitants to leave.  \n  \n Avathrael isn't satisfied\u2014they desire perfection. Over time, the shadows shift and unspool, causing Avathrael to maintain their realm repeatedly, making and remaking and making yet again. Avathrael believes the key to achieving their realm's perfection lays in planar magic\u2014 specifically, making Gloaming Arbor a demiplane.",

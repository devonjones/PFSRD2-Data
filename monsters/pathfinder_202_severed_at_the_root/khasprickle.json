                    "text": "Khasprickle is a bully, through and through, and like most pukwudgies, he's extremely sensitive to getting the respect he thinks he deserves. He despises being kept waiting, sees insult in every action and turn of phrase, and considers anyone who disagrees with him a fool. Hearty, nimble, and incredibly stubborn, Khasprickle is a formidable foe.  \n  \n Early in the campaign, Khasprickle is a social foil. He's a troublemaker who disagrees with the PCs and who should find himself on the opposite side of a conflict from them. His misdeeds are minor at first\u2014 mostly gripes, complaints, and colorful language. Soon, after receiving the encouragement of some other bitter, like-minded fey, Khasprickle forms his raiding party, Last Stop, and rampages through the forest, causing trouble and destruction. At this point, Khasprickle is accompanied by two of his close friends and cronies: Ashendeath the elananx and Sylvarindarian, a vicious pixie. The trio feed off of one another's anger and ire, growing more brazen and bolder as time passes.  \n  \n At this point, Khasprickle becomes a bigger problem but still remains a social issue. He's someone to undermine, discredit, or win over. The PCs likely work hard here to earn Khasprickle's focus and keep it, in the hopes that he can be rehabilitated or can learn to feel remorse for his actions. Unfortunately for the PCs, Khasprickle can't be rehabilitated, though he can be influenced. Any self-improvements that Khasprickle performs are temporary.  \n  \n Later, after Ruzadoya's election to leader of the Wildwood Lodge, Khasprickle becomes a true villain. He leads his raiding party into the Verduran Forest to slaughter foresters, loggers, and anyone else he suspects has ties to Andoran or Taldor. He threatens and harms the inhabitants of the Verduran Forest in an attempt to coerce them into joining Ruzadoya. Many lives are lost. Soon, as the PCs focus on collecting objects and weapons that once belonged to Ghorus, the PCs discover that Khasprickle shares the same task, though he's working for the enemy. It should be clear that a dangerous weapon in Khasprickle's hands would be disastrous. It's at this point that the scales fully tip, and Khasprickle becomes downright villainous. Under Ruzadoya's leadership, he has gone from bad to worse, and now it's up to the PCs to bring an end to the misery he's causing.  \n  \n The PCs finally confront Khasprickle outside Ghorus's Garden, where he has captured and tormented the immortal dweomercat Felivaine, an ally of the PCs. Khasprickle serves as a mini-boss that has been built up for quite some time. By this point, the PCs should despise Khasprickle and everything he stands for, and they should believe that, this time, they can't let him off with a warning\u2014some people just can't be saved.  \n  \n***Recall Knowledge - Fey* (*Nature*)**: DC 36  \n***Unspecific Lore***: DC 34  \n***Specific Lore***: DC 31",

            "text": "Khasprickle is a sadistic bully who enjoys causing trouble. Like most pukwudgies, Khasprickle is incredibly proud and obsessed with being respected\u2014 he expects mortals to fawn over him, fey to admit his superiority, and everyone else to be content to simply bask in his presence and recognize his apparent greatness.  \n  \n Despite his fondness for tricks, pranks, and the unexpected, Khasprickle believes that a deal must be upheld, and he expects it to be so. Yet day after day, year after year, and decade after decade, Khasprickle has watched the greedy loggers and foresters of Andoran and Taldor reap the bounty of the Verduran Forest, cutting down the very trees under the protection of the Wildwood Treaty. This blatant breach of the Wildwood Treaty is downright disrespectful\u2014and nobody hates disrespect like a pukwudgie!  \n  \n In retaliation for a lifetime of past slights and countless grave insults, Khasprickle resolved to smack some respect into the forest's neighboring nations of Andoran and Taldor. He eagerly joined the retaliatory expeditions and named his raiding party the \u201cLast Stop.\u201d Khasprickle considered this raiding party a part of the \u201cwild hunt\u201d\u2014a blasphemous pronouncement sure to draw the ire of the true wild hunt if they ever found out.  \n  \n Despite the delusional audacity of these actions, Khasprickle became an outspoken voice against Andoran's and Taldor's illegal foresting practices and the countless, everyday people who take advantage of the Wildwood Treaty. Khasprickle commands growing influence among the Verduran Forests's offended inhabitants.  \n  \n When Ruzadoya Swiftmane was elected leader of the Wildwood Lodge, resulting in the founding of the Rootweft Lodge under Emorga-All-Seer, Khasprickle eagerly supported Ruzadoya and her \u201ctrue\u201d Wildwood Lodge. In the aftermath of this event, he was emboldened, and his attacks became deadlier and more virulent. Thanks to his dedication, Khasprickle has been both promoted\u2014and emboldened\u2014by Ruzadoya Swiftmane. If left unchecked, he's sure to cause havoc.",

Unless otherwise stated, polymorph spells don't allow the target to take on the appearance of a specific individual creature, but rather just a generic creature of a general type or ancestry.  \n  \n If you take on a battle form with a polymorph spell, the special statistics can be adjusted only by circumstance bonuses, status bonuses, and penalties. Unless otherwise noted, the battle form prevents you from casting spells, speaking, and using most manipulate actions that require hands. (If there's doubt about whether you can use an action, the GM decides.) Your gear is absorbed into you; the constant abilities of your gear still function, but you can't activate any items.

To cement their safety as Torag's chosen people, the dwarves have erected dozens of statues befitting the manifestation of the Grand Defender. The most famous of these is a colossal likeness of Taargick, the King of the Sky. Weathered and damaged beyond repair after a half dozen battles in which the Grand Defender protected the city, it now stands where the herald last left it, gazing over Stonebreach.",

While a true messenger of a deity, the Grand Defender manifests itself in a unique way to other heralds. The chassis of the Grand Defender exists within Forgeheart, Torag's subterranean realm in Heaven. This frame is empty, however, and can only serve basic functions, much like a golem. When faithful call upon the Grand Defender, Torag rouses the construct with spirits. As the might of the Grand Defender comes from Torag's will and the power of the souls within, the Grand Defender can take on any number of forms. Torag can send these spirits to alter any sufficiently sized statue of a dwarven ancestor. This process temporarily converts the carving into the Grand Defender itself, complete with its abilities and equipment.",

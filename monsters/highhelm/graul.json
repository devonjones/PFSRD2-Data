Travelers through the tunnels surrounding Highhelm are advised to be on the lookout for blind and darkvision-possessing fauna that appear to be congregating and making homes near bioluminescent fungi clusters or other natural light sources they might normally ignore, as this behavior often indicates the presence of a graul's hunting ground.",

These highly specialized ambush predators possess a natural camouflage that renders them completely imperceptible to all forms of darkvision as they float silently through the darkness, allowing them to hunt creatures that rely on specialized senses to navigate their lightless domain. Surprisingly cunning, grauls are adept at using their magical talents for illusion and mimicry to separate potential prey from allies and light sources alike.",

In any event, shatterlings sometimes see this realm when they leap through mirrors but can never reach it, an inaccessibility that fuels their hatred. Many shatterlings spend their days leaping between mirrors, hoping to catch elusive glimpses of the mirrorworld they will never touch.",

Shatterlings usually inhabit areas with plenty of mirrors, like carnival fun houses, opulent manors, or playhouses. Capricious and malevolent, shatterlings quickly kill or scare away anyone else in such areas, as they desire to be the only ones to gaze into the mirrors they claim as their own.",

Whether or not a given waterway will be a cause of death is unclear, but many people in the Sodden Lands avoid taking chances, building their homes on stilts to avoid the unexpected release of deadly fog.",

When an earthquake or other geological phenomena releases toxic gases, these gases can build up beneath lakes and other large bodies of water. Eventually, they escape the water, expanding into massive clouds that cover the immediate area. Its silent, unexpected arrival can take thousands of lives in an instant. Confused, in pain, and desperate for a way out, the dying souls become trapped in the noxious cloud and amass into this horrifying creature.  \n  \n While not truly undead, a screaming sulfur shares many similarities with undead creatures, including the malice of vengeful spirits and the hatred of all living creatures who breathe freely and painlessly. A screaming sulfur resembles a cloud made of countless, featureless faces, mouths agape and releasing ghastly wails.",

They know their history and value its integrity and privacy\u2014if younger ancestries like humanity aren\u2019t interested in learning from lizardfolk empires dating back to before the first human knocked two rocks together to make their first campfire, that\u2019s fine with them.  \n  \n The word \u201clizardfolk\u201d is an excellent example of humanity\u2019s narrow-sighted view of this culture. The name of their people is \u201ciruxi,\u201d but these reptilian humanoids have patiently and good-naturedly accepted the name \u201clizardfolk\u201d as a variant, and they generally resist urges to call humans and other mammalians similarly derivative names in return. Iruxis dwell and thrive in all tropical and temperate biomes, but they are most at home in swamplands, coastal regions, and riverlands, for they are talented swimmers, and fish and aquatic plants make up a large part of their preferred diets.",

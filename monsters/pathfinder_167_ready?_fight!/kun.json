When flocks of birds or schools of fish cast their dappled shadows upon a kun, they might grow weary of their solitude or become curious about the realm above. In extremely rare circumstances and for their own mysterious reasons, a kun might sacrifice some of their power to undergo a permanent, one-time transformation. In a final dramatic act, the kun flings themself up and out of the ocean, allowing the sun to fully wash over them. In the process, the kun transforms from the hateful fish into a noble and curious bird called a peng.",

A kun remains as far away from other creatures as they can, subsisting on only their own icy hatred. They can consume and digest prey, but such feedings are incidental.

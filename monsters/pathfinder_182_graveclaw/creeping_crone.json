Although this is probably due to the protection provided by their heartstones, it might also be a side effect of long years of soul-trading in the foulest pits of the evil planes. Some stain lingers on night hags, whisking away their souls upon death so they're unable to rise as undead. Perhaps night hags can't resist making a bargain with their own souls and, upon their deaths, this payment becomes due.",

Unless otherwise noted, the battle form prevents you from casting spells, speaking, and using most manipulate actions that require hands.

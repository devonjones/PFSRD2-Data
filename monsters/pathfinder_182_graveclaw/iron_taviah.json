When the characters investigated Kepgeda in *Pathfinder Adventure Path #181: Zombie Feast*, they learned of her connection to the Graveclaw. The characters learn more about Iron Taviah and the coven from the vengeful Drusilla, and the first member of the coven they face in battle is Taviah herself. But Iron Taviah is a creature of many secrets. After her defeat her body is secreted away on the Shadow Plane, but the characters are destined to see Taviah again, in a fashion, during the events of *Pathfinder Adventure Path #183: Field of Maidens.*",

            "text": "Iron Taviah doesn't remember where her story begins. Old even for an annis hag, who can live exceptionally long lives, she wandered south of the Inner Sea for over a century. Ruthazek, the Gorilla King, occasionally bartered for her services, trading her prisoners and rare alchemical ingredients. For decades, she kept a floating hut built on the corpse of a megalodon in the Sodden Lands. Eventually members of the Magaambya had enough of her villainy and drove Taviah from the Mwangi Expanse. Wounded, she fled east through the Mana Wastes. Repelled by the golem guardians of Nex, she turned south to Geb.  \n  \n In a land where the undead rule and corpses openly walk the streets, an annis hag attracted relatively little attention. Dragging her wounded leg\u2014the scars left by the Magaambyans would never fully heal\u2014Taviah took shelter in Axan Wood and built a cottage. The site of her new home was no accident; she constructed it where she saw the boundary with the Shadow Plane was especially thin. She swiftly dominated the local wildlife and those who dared to share this corner of the gloomy forest with her. When Nathnelma went looking for hags to form a coven called the Graveclaw, Iron Taviah's reputation spoke for itself. Taviah accepted Nathnelma's offer on the condition that their coven should remain scattered. Taviah had grown comfortable in the Axan Wood and didn't trust a new home Nathnelma or her other \u201csisters\u201d might provide her.  \n  \n Taviah's life took a tragic turn when she first saw Neboah, a handsome human necromancer, passing time in the woods with his beloved, a fey woman named Drusilla. At once, Taviah thought of nothing but capturing him. When Drusilla left to bathe nearby, Taviah seized Neboah and retreated to her cottage, protected by occult magic and supernatural allies. Neboah, held prisoner, desperately seduced Taviah to lower her guard and the lonely hag fell for his charm. After they conceived twins, Neboah took his chance to escape, but Taviah caught him and killed him in a rage.  \n  \n Taviah's many other children had been sent abroad, seeded among innocent families as changelings, in the way of hags. But her new children were Taviah's only link to the man she loved, in her cruel and twisted way. She named the daughter Kepgeda and raised her, teaching her occult rituals and necromancy. Taviah's son Nebumi was too much like his father for the hag to bear; she neglected the boy, who died of loneliness. When Kepgeda was old enough to earn her own reputation, Taviah allowed her to go, but took one of her daughter's fingers as insurance and punishment. Taviah has cried bitter tears ever since, for though she's surrounded by sycophants and minions, the hag is again alone.  \n  \n Meanwhile, Chancellor Kemnebi hatched his scheme to dominate the entire region with undead armies loyal only to him. To execute this plan, he needs a necromantic toxin that will turn Geb's neighbors into a source of undead soldiers. He turned to the Graveclaw, and now Iron Taviah and her sisters toil in their kitchens to make the Blood Lord's poison.",

Unlike a normal Grapple, Taviah doesn't need to be within reach and can move as she pleases, and a successful attempt lasts until the creature Escapes (DC 24), causing the cage to crumble into rust. Any creature can attempt to destroy the cage by attacking it; the cage has an AC of 19, Hardness 10, and 40 Hit Points."

If it comes under the effect of a second polymorph effect, the second polymorph effect attempts to counteract the first. If it succeeds, it takes effect, and if it fails, the spell has no effect on that target. Any Strikes specifically granted by a polymorph effect are magical. Unless otherwise stated, polymorph spells don't allow the target to take on the appearance of a specific individual creature, but rather just a generic creature of a general type or ancestry.  \n  \n If you take on a battle form with a polymorph spell, the special statistics can be adjusted only by circumstance bonuses, status bonuses, and penalties. Unless otherwise noted, the battle form prevents you from casting spells, speaking, and using most manipulate actions that require hands. (If there's doubt about whether you can use an action, the GM decides.) Your gear is absorbed into you; the constant abilities of your gear still function, but you can't activate any items.",

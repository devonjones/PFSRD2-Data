In this case, the shabti is liberated and left to wander Golarion on their own.  \n  \n Freed but without purpose, many shabti try to recreate the lives that they think they were supposed to lead, replaying out the themes and situations from false memories that fill their heads. Others find themselves tormented for ages by the fact they were solely created to endure punishment for sins committed by another. Some shabti revel in the freedom of their new endless existence, traveling the world in search of sensation and meaning.  \n  \n A rare few shabti find purpose in aiding Pharasma.

They often take the forms of raptors such as owls, using their keen senses to evaluate situations from high above before swooping in to aid imperiled mortals.  \n  \n Adventurers who befriend a sage guide are fortunate indeed; in addition to providing sage counsel before conflict begins, sage guides can restore and tend to their allies in the aftermath of a violent dispute.  \n  \n In many stories, the sage guide assumes the form of a large owl whose proud breast is composed of hard stone. This depiction combines the wisdom commonly attributed to the owl with the strength and fortitude of the earth.",

Some legends say that the first spirit guides were the perfect conceptual forms of animals, and that from them, eagles, foxes, bears, and other mortal animals were born. Each guide displayed an interest in mortal affairs, watching over communities and imparting their gifts. Fox shared his cunning with the mortals he befriended, while Bear taught them how to survive and endure.  \n  \n Over the passing of countless mortal generations, new spirit guides were born, many of them possessing traits from two or more of the original spirit guides. In the ancient human nation of Sarkoris, the people abandoned the worship of traditional gods in favor of venerating the spirit guides who watched over them. While the people of some neighboring nations saw this as heresy, to the old Sarkorians, this worship was perfectly natural. The same beings who had taught their forebears lessons that allowed them to survive and thrive still walked among them.  \n  \n Spirit guides can form bonds with mortal partners. While many spirit guides create a permanent bond with a mortal, such as the relationship between the spirit guides of Sarkoris and the mortal spiritual leaders known as god callers, some instead form temporary bonds, either to test the prospective mortal before committing or because a permanent bond is undesirable. It's not uncommon for a single spirit guide to form bonds with recurring generations of a family or community, protecting and guiding mortals they've grown fond of or who do them a great service.",

The bond ends if the spirit guide or the mortal dies.  \n  \n This bond strengthens the spirit guide's connection to the Material Plane. While bonded, the spirit guide loses the incorporeal and spirit traits, loses their immunities and resistances, and changes their Strikes to deal the appropriate physical damage (typically piercing or slashing) instead of force damage."

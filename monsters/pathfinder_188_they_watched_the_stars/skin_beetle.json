Such umasi can command skin beetles to harvest more flesh to keep their decaying bodies intact.",

The skin beetle rolls this coated flesh into a ball, then stores it under an exposed tree root or rock for leaner times. Signs of skin beetle activity include excoriated skeletons and the smell of the beetles' preservative saliva.",

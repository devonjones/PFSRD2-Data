            "text": "Glimmervines are carnivorous creeping vines with sparkling white flowers that open to bloom only at night. They flourish most in high altitudes and cold climates, where they survive by dazzling small prey with their iridescent blossoms before crushing them to death with impossibly strong tendrils. The blood and decomposing flesh of their prey seep into the ground like fertilizer for glimmervines' roots to absorb as nutrients. Because scarps and gulleys caked with gore tend to deter future victims, glimmervines instinctively know not to linger in one spot for long.  \n  \n Glimmervines are mostly dormant during the day. Clinging to the sides of mountains and cliffs, they're easily mistaken for mundane climbing plants such as ivy or morning glory. When night falls, though, glimmervines' spectacular reflective flowers make their entrancing nature plain for all to see.  \n  \n Glimmervines are closely related to assassin vines, who employ similar ambush tactics and feeding behaviors, but the former is easily discernible by the shiny white blooms in place of an assassin vine's small red berries. These petals are coated with iridescent veins that absorb sunlight during the day and give off an eerie yet beautiful glow at night. The glistening patina attracts pollinating insects.  \n  \n On their own, glimmervines don't pose much of a threat to most creatures. Though its root-based sensory organs are formidable in close proximity, a glimmervine can't sense creatures farther than 60 feet away, making escape as easy as getting out of range of their slow movement. The true danger of these plants comes from glimmervine thickets\u2014dense patches of glimmervines that can entangle entire hillsides or ravines. Woe be unto a hapless traveler caught in the midst of a glimmervine thicket at sundown.",

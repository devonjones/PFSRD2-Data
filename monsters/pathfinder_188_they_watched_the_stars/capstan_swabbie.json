Spars spaced evenly around its frame complete the look, while castors on its base give the swabbie mobility. A capstan swabbie also sports a few small pegs around its diameter. It can use these appendages to \u201cgrab\u201d other ropes from the rigging to help sail the ship. Some crews decorate their capstan swabbies with paint or rags to give the constructs a personal touch.  \n  \n A capstan swabbie instinctively protects its captain's ship. Using short ropes attached to its sides, the swabbie can lash and trip foes or make emergency repairs to itself or its vessel. Far more dangerous, of course, is the anchor to which the swabbie's longest rope is attached. A capstan swabbie can swing this anchor in wide arcs and reel it back in at a moment's notice.",

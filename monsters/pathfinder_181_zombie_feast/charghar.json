There are also some living people in the nation who've resorted to cannibalism: either downtrodden folks who cook and eat their neighbors and kin out of necessity, or socialites who dine on such fare because it's fashionable. Regardless of the reason for cooking people, these efforts can create vengeful undead creatures who lurk wherever meals are being prepared, luring cooks into making careless or deadly mistakes.  \n  \n Charghars have spectral humanoid forms, while their physical manifestations appear much as they did after they were cooked\u2014as charred remains, gory corpses bearing disembodied butchered chunks that float nearby, or loose assemblages of boiled bones.",

            "text": "Skull fairies are malicious beings spawned from the heads of those who die after exposure to the malignant energies of the Shadow Plane. They aren't fey, but their petite, winged forms and tendency for malevolent mischief has caused the appellation \u201cskull fairy\u201d to stick.  \n  \n After bursting from the skull of the deceased, a skull fairy seeks out victims to behead. Skull fairies enjoy nothing more than the horrific sound of wrenching a head free from a body. They often wear the skulls of their most recent victim like caps atop their bulbous, oversized heads. Skull fairies take heads they've acquired to isolated caves, where they carefully strip off the flesh and put the skulls on display. If the skull fairy feels the need for new headgear, they hollow out a fresh skull to wear and retire the old one to a place of prominence.  \n  \n A group of exactly three skull fairies who have each been alive for at least 13 years become much more powerful than their solitary or younger kin. Members of such a coven become stronger and more intelligent, and they set their minds to evil and chaos on a much wider scale\u2014although anything more complicated than wandering about to twist off heads might seem aspirational to a skull fairy. Skull fairies that join a coven gain the elite adjustments and often acquire more powerful innate spells. *Nondetection* and *stinking cloud* are the most common spells a skull fairy coven can access, but others exist. A skull fairy can only join a coven consisting exclusively of other skull fairies",

A coven member can contribute to a coven spell with a single-action spellcasting activity that has a single verbal component. If two coven members have contributed these actions within the last round, a third member can cast a coven spell on her turn by spending the normal spellcasting actions. A coven can cast its coven spells an unlimited number of times but can cast only one coven spell each round. All covens grant the 8th-level *baleful polymorph* spell and all the following spells, which the coven can cast at any level up to 5th: *augury*, *charm*, *clairaudience*, *clairvoyance*, *dream message*, *illusory disguise*, *illusory scene*, *prying eye*, and *talking corpse*. Individual creatures with the coven ability also grant additional spells to any coven they join. A coven can also cast the *control weather* ritual, with a DC of 23 instead of the standard DC.  \n  \n If a coven member leaving the coven or the death of a coven member brings the coven below three members, the remaining members keep their elite adjustments for 24 hours, but without enough members to contribute the necessary actions, they can\u2019t cast coven spells.",

            "text": "Osoyo is alien to Golarion, and while it was first encountered by the elves of Sovyrian, the Blackfrost Whale was alien there as well. At that time, in the earliest years of what is known on Golarion as the Age of Legends, Osoyo held only a small fraction of the potential power it represents today, and yet was still dangerous enough that Sovyrian's High Families wanted it far from their home. They lured the entity from Sovyrian, perhaps intending to escort it out into deep space, but their magic began to falter and they were forced to choose Golarion as the site of its prison. They chose the north pole, figuring that as life spread on their sister planet, this remote location would ensure Osoyo's prison would never be discovered.  \n  \n But the Castrovelian elves underestimated the people known as saumen kar. When they discovered the Blackfrost Whale, the saumen kar took it upon themselves to build a vast city and temple above Osoyo's prison to ensure it remained locked away. Earthfall disrupted these goals, and now, thousands of years later, only one saumen kar remains alive, remembering the ancient ways of his nearly extinct people\u2014Ainamuuren. Then, during the Missing Moment, Ainamuuren was captured by agents of the Blackfrost Whale. He now languishes near Osoyo's prison, slowly being corrupted into something alien. Once he completes this corruption, Osoyo will be fully free from its prison.  \n  \n Ainamuuren currently lies in state, not quite dead, but much changed. Blood and blackfrost mat his fur, and writhing tentacles of oily black flesh have grown from his belly, sides, and throat. Pustules on his face bloat and burst, revealing pale, glaring eyes. If this corruption is allowed to run its full course, Ainamuuren's body will transform completely and then burst, turning inside out and serving as a point of entry back into the world for the Blackfrost Whale.  \n  \n A detailed exploration of Ainamuuren, including more details about his peoples' history and stats for him in his uncorrupted state, appear on pages 6\u201311 of *Pathfinder Lost Omens Monsters of Myth*. You can consult these pages for more background about the last saumen kar, but within the context of this Adventure Path, his current status as a corrupted victim of the Blackfrost Whale is the version of him the gatewalkers will encounter.",

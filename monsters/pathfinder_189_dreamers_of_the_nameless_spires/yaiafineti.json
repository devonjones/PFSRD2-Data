To survive in such harsh conditions, the yaiafineti, or dusk poppy, sprouts independent polyps that detach and then creep across the tundra in search of food for their matriarch.  \n  \n Dusk poppies sprout from spores that attach to carcasses, but they only blossom during the long twilight unique to the Crown of the World. The perfect conditions for their development are so rare that yaiafineti have developed a vigorous appetite. They feed unceasingly. Much of their energy goes to developing more polyps, and one plant can easily spawn a small infestation of these deadly bulbs.  \n  \n The plants send out runner shoots that quickly develop purple bulbs. These bulbs, the plant's polyps, sprout many long, hooked vines before detaching from the mother plant. Polyps are short lived but active, foraging for a week or so before they shrivel and die. These polyps aren't dangerous unless handled. They secrete a fine dust that acts as a paralyzing poison that seizes the nervous system of creatures who come in contact with them.  \n  \n **Paralyzing Poison** (poison) **Saving Throw** DC 19 Fortitude; **Maximum Duration** 6 rounds; **Stage 1** flat-footed and clumsy 1 (1 round); **Stage 2** flat-footed and clumsy 2 (1 round); **Stage 3** paralyzed (1 round)",

If a swallowed creature is of the maximum size listed, the monster can\u2019t use Swallow Whole again.

The monster attempts an Athletics check opposed by the grabbed creature\u2019s Reflex DC. If it succeeds, it swallows the creature. The monster\u2019s mouth or jaws no longer grab a creature it has swallowed, so the monster is free to use them to Strike or Grab once again. The monster can\u2019t attack creatures it has swallowed.  \n  \n A swallowed creature is grabbed, is slowed 1, and has to hold its breath or start suffocating. The swallowed creature takes the listed amount of damage when first swallowed and at the end of each of its turns while it\u2019s swallowed. If the victim Escapes this ability\u2019s grabbed condition, it exits through the monster\u2019s mouth. This frees any other creature grabbed in the monster\u2019s mouth or jaws. A swallowed creature can attack the monster that has swallowed it, but only with unarmed attacks or with weapons of light Bulk or less. The engulfing creature is flat-footed against the attack. If the monster takes piercing or slashing damage equaling or exceeding the listed Rupture value from a single attack or spell, the engulfed creature cuts itself free. A creature that gets free by either Escaping or cutting itself free can immediately breathe and exits the swallowing monster\u2019s space.  \n  \n If the monster dies, a swallowed creature can be freed by creatures adjacent to the corpse if they spend a combined total of 3 actions cutting the monster open with a weapon or unarmed attack that deals piercing or slashing damage.",

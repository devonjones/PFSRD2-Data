They were created in eons past by the mysterious First Horsemen of the Apocalypse to serve as agents of the end times within the Material Plane. Urdefhans continue to honor their creators by worshipping the wretched beings who rule over the plane of Abaddon, and like their fiendish lieges, urdefhans exist for one reason and one reason alone: to kill.  \n  \n While urdefhans are humanoid and dwell together in large groups, this is where their similarities to surface ancestries end. Their visages are horrific, with transparent skin and musculature displaying their glistening entrails, gleaming bones, and perhaps worst of all, their baleful red eyes. This, combined with their gaping maws full of sharp fangs, works to create the false impression that these beings are some sort of vampiric undead, not creatures of living flesh and blood. When an urdefhan\u2019s life comes to an end, their flesh quickly curdles and then bursts in a wave of awful corruption that spreads to the flesh of other creatures in the area. The typical urdefhan views their eventual demise as a disappointment, for once they\u2019re dead, their chances to kill will finally come to an end.  \n  \n Urdefhans\u2019 primary concern is death and how to inflict it in the goriest, most painful, and widespread ways. Beyond this ethos of violence, urdefhans concern themselves only tangentially with matters such as formal modes of warfare or aspects of their damnable religion. When an urdefhan is not actively engaged in violence, their giddy cruelty is tempered only by a sense of self-preservation that ensures they survive long enough to spread the \u201cblessings\u201d of their daemonic patrons. They pass the time between wars inventing new weapons, developing new diseases, and researching awful new magic, all in preparation for the next inevitable conflict.",

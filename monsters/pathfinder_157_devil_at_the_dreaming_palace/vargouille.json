In this daemonic nightmare realm, vargouilles play a role similar to that of a raven or vulture, although they augment these roles with a malevolent delight in causing pain and anguish that no scavenger bird could ever hope to match. A vargouille is larger than a human head, typically between 12 and 20 inches high with a 15- to 35-inch wingspan. While vargouilles aren't natives of the Material Plane, they can be found there nevertheless, occupying graveyards, ancient battlefields, or anywhere one can find remnants of death and decay.",

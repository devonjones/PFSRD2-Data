Skilled fleshwarpers, however, can tease out a morlock's genetic differences to make an entirely different creature. Creating a dreshkan involves replacing the morlock's bones with a metal skeleton. This new skeleton is often heavily augmented, such as with spiderlike limbs protruding from the spine or magazines of tiny, deadly needles. Arcane electricity courses through the dreshkan thereafter, making it jumpy and irritable.  \n  \n Morlocks view dreshkans as impressive fusions of flesh and technology and gladly fight alongside these creatures, whom they view as paragons of morlock potential.",

The reconstitution of flesh results in countless variations of fleshwarps, and the following are just a couple of examples of these horrors.  \n  \nAlthough twisting victims into horrid shapes is a well-known pastime of evil drow, other subterranean monsters have stolen these practices or developed them independently.

Subterranean communities have collapsed entire tunnels to prevent the creatures from reaching their settlements.  \n  \n Many shanrigol behemoths absorb enough brain matter to form crude intelligences and take a serpentine or humanoid shape. They're more varied in their abilities than shanrigol heaps, as they often gain abilities from their constituent creatures. The shanrigol behemoth presented below contains flesh from driders and urdefhans, giving it a web attack and necrotic decay ability. Not all shanrigol behemoths have these two abilities, but should have other abilities to replace them.",

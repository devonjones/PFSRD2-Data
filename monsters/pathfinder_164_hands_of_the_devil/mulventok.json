The reconstitution of flesh results in countless variations of fleshwarps, and the following are just a couple of examples of these horrors.  \n  \nAlthough twisting victims into horrid shapes is a well-known pastime of evil drow, other subterranean monsters have stolen these practices or developed them independently.

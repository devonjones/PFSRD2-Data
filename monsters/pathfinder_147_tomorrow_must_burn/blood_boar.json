The species originated from a type of large feral boar native to Nidal\u2019s shadowy Uskwood, and blood boars retain their predecessors\u2019 gray fur, red eyes, and exceptional senses. The intensive breeding process to produce blood boars\u2014augmented by the selective application of magic\u2014grants the creatures an unparalleled awareness of blood, including the ability to precisely detect a bloodied creature\u2019s location and movements, allowing the boars to track their prey from up to a mile away.  \n  \n Blood boars\u2019 keepers groom and mark the animals to enhance their already unsettling appearance. While from a distance, a blood boar might be mistaken for an ordinary pig, up close the differences are stark. Blood-red eyes, ashen fur, and unnaturally sharp tusks frame hundreds of pounds of raw muscle, the veins of which can be seen through the boar\u2019s ghastly pale flesh. Chains, manacles, and spikes are typical blood boar accessories, ensuring the boars are as fearsome as possible.  \n  \n A blood boar\u2019s ability to track its quarry using only the scent of the target\u2019s blood has been the bane of many thieves, brigands, and the occasional illicit lover, but none have as much cause to fear the beasts as slaves in pursuit of freedom. Even washing off spilled blood does nothing to deter the blood boar\u2019s pursuit if it already has the scent. As a result, many halflings in the Bellflower Network zealously practice disarming and nonlethal combat techniques specifically to avoid accidental bloodshed during an escape.",

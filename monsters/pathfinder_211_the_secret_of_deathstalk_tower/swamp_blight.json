When building an encounter with a swamp blight, consider adjusting existing undead to match more thematically with the swampland environment, and avoid using undead that wouldn't make sense in such a region. Adjusting an undead creature's innate spells to be primal spells associated with swampy regions is a great way to achieve this customization.",

If a creature dominated by this spell leaves the cursed domain, the effects of dominate immediately end, but as long as the dominated creature remains in the cursed domain, the duration is unlimited. When a blight targets a mindless fungi, ooze, or plant, its *dominate* spell loses the mental trait.  \n  \n **Cursed Domain** (curse, primal) Once per year, when in a terrain that is compatible with its type (such as a swamp for a swamp blight), the blight can infuse the land around it with its corrupted essence by performing a rite that takes one day. The region in a 5-mile radius becomes its cursed domain; this effect does not extend into incompatible terrain and does not move with the blight. The point at which the blight cursed the domain becomes its epicenter.  \n Within their cursed domain, a blight ignores all non-magical difficult terrain and always gains the benefits of the Cover Tracks action. Blights also have an imprecise sense for the locations of all creatures within their domain and can communicate with all sapient creatures they detect within their domain using telepathy. Each blight's cursed domain has additional properties specific to the blight's type. A blight outside of a cursed domain becomes slowed 1 until it returns to its own or another blight's cursed domain.  \n Removing this curse requires a character with the Break Curse feat (or a similar ability); this activity must be performed at the cursed domain's epicenter. If the blight that cursed the domain is dead, checks to counteract a cursed domain gain a +4 circumstance bonus.  \n  \n **Oversee Domain** [#] (concentrate, primal) The blight projects its senses to any point in its cursed domain, gaining a precise sense of its surroundings with a 500-foot radius until the end of its next turn. A blight can cast *dominate* through this sensory link. A blight can Sustain this ability, but cannot use it to extend its senses beyond the edges of its domain.  \n  \n **Rejuvenation** (primal) If a blight is slain within its cursed domain, its body melts into the surrounding environment and a new blight of the same type spontaneously forms in 1d10 days at the cursed domain's epicenter unless the curse is removed before then. The new blight retains all the memories of the previous blight.",

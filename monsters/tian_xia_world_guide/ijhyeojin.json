Over time, they rejected their roles and became sakhils. Some did this due to a sense of injustice over having to atone for their sins in the afterlife, but all do so partially out of a desperate desire to reclaim their memories\u2014for ijhyeojins are named for the fear they manifest, the fear of being forgotten. They prey on people who are socially isolated by circumstances or those obsessed with their legacy, slowly cutting their victims off from friends, professional contacts, and family. Ijhyeojins particularly enjoy infiltrating medical facilities to prey on patients who fear about being forgotten in their deaths, snatching away crucial memories from them or their visiting loved ones. Hunting in this way also grants the sahkils ideal positioning to lure joseung sajas to their demise.  \n  \n Ijhyeojins resemble the pale-skinned psychopomps they used to be, except their faces have no distinguishable features, like a skull with a smooth layer of skin pulled over it. Their bodies continue to twist and grow the longer they live.",

These fiends have drastically changed from their dedicated psychopomp predecessors. They are creatures of spite and torment, fear and disgust. They exploit the most common and rare fears for their own perverse satisfaction, and they want nothing more than to frighten mortals and make them question their reason for existence.   \n  \nMost sahkils lurk on the Ethereal Plane, but they frequently invade the Material Plane to torment mortals and spread terror. They use their innate ability to slip between the veils of the Ethereal and Material effortlessly, often stalking their targets for days or weeks before enacting their devious plots.",

Whichever head is in the lead grants a different action the Great Flood can use during its first turn each round (see Coordinated Actions).  \n**Aloof\u2014The Flood's Command** [#] (divine) The aloof head casts a 5th-rank *command* (Will DC 42).  \n **Ambitious\u2014Claim Position** [#] (divine) The ambitious head declares a divine position above its station. It gains 100 temporary Hit Points for 1 minute. It also gains a weakness 20 to spirit damage and can't Claim Position again for 1 minute.  \n **Assertive\u2014Rush In** [#] The Great Flood Swims, then makes a melee Strike.  \n**Capricious\u2014Changing Thoughts** [#] (concentrate) The capricious head counteracts each mental effect on themself as a 10th-rank effect with a +32 counteract modifier.  \n **People Pleaser**\u2014Build Consensus [#] (concentrate) The heads discuss and audibly agree on a creature to target. Until they Build Consensus again, their Strikes deal an additional 20 precision damage to that creature.  \n **Perfectionist\u2014Find Fault** [#] (auditory, concentrate, emotion, linguistic, mental) The perfectionist head criticizes a creature within their aura. The creature must succeed at a DC 42 Will save or take 9d6 persistent mental damage.  \n **Playful**\u2014Bad Jokes [#] The playful head makes an ill-timed quip about the impermanence of life. They attempt to Demoralize each creature within their aura.  \n **Secretive**\u2014Secret Movement [#] (concentrate, divine, teleportation) The Great Flood is invisible until the end of their turn and teleports to an open space within their aura.  \n  \n***Recall Knowledge - Beast* (*Arcana*, *Nature*)**: DC 50  \n***Unspecific Lore***: DC 48  \n***Specific Lore***: DC 45",

            "text": "There are few creatures capable of such ecological destruction while staying as humorous and lighthearted as the Great Flood. The Great Flood towers with their giant serpent body and nine humanoid heads, each one with a different personality, though all serve the same purpose\u2014to vanquish all signs of life that shouldn't be where they are. This creature intends to maintain the balance of the universe, ensuring that nothing takes up more space than necessary. Unfortunately, the judgment of where someone or something should be is only seen and weighed by the 18 eyes of the Great Flood, with little regard to mortal input.  \n  \n The Great Flood is an immortal, or at least ageless, being who hibernates for 12 years at a stretch. On the thirteenth year, they emerge from the depths of the oceans and begin weighing the state of the world and the environments closest to their resting place: should the first thing they see on dry land be destroyed? Each of the Great Flood's nine heads lends their thoughts and insights to this deliberation, and upon reaching a consensus, they'll either carry on to the next location or they'll drown the land, immersing miles of dry land in salty waters from the ocean. In instances where they perceive the excess life as particularly problematic, they'll even decide to poison the waters with their bitter breath to ensure that nothing survives the judgment they've decreed. The Great Flood, despite its inherently destructive nature, isn't actually bloodthirsty and will often afford an opportunity for poor townsfolk to state their case and beg for the lives of their town to be saved. While the Great Flood has the capacity for mercy and consideration, the godlike creature stands adamant once they've made their decision. One or two of the heads might feel a twinge of guilt and tell a small joke to the townsfolk, relieving themselves of the mental pressure, before murdering an entire village.  \n  \n The nine personalities of the serpentine creature often run into contention with each other. One is a perfectionist, while another is aloof; one is assertive, while another is playful; one is capricious, while another is suspicious; one is ambitious, while the other is a people pleaser. The last one is quiet and secretive, only ever whispering to the heads closest to them. Though the heads squabble like siblings, they eventually always make a compromise.",

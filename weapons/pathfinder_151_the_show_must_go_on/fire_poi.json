While lit, fire poi cast dim light in a 10-foot radius; in combat, they deal 1d4 bludgeoning plus 1d4 fire damage. On a critical hit with a lit fire poi, the target takes 1 persistent fire damage . The fire can be extinguished using the Interact action. When unlit, the poi deal only the listed bludgeoning damage.

The fully covered deck protects the vessel's 80 rowers and complement of 50 soldiers from arrows and incendiary weapons. In addition, this armored deck is covered with iron spikes to discourage enemies from attempting to board.  \n   \n On the bow of the vessel is mounted a dragon head which can emit sulfur smoke to effectively hide its movement in close combat. Below the dragon head is mounted a large anchor with a wooden crest shaped like a face, and these can be used to ram into enemy ships.",

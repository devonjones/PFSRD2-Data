The specific implement isn't part of the cauldron and doesn't need to have any particular magic; it simply focuses the pilot's desire to have the cauldron soar into the air and direct it where the pilot wants it to go.  \n   \n When not in use as a vehicle, the cauldron can be used to boil food and prepare alchemical ingredients, just like any mundane cauldron. To activate the cauldron, however, it must be empty.",

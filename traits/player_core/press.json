You can\u2019t use a press action when it\u2019s not your turn, even if you use the Ready activity.  \n  \nSome actions with the press trait also grant an effect on a failure. The effects that are added on a failure don\u2019t apply on a critical failure. If your press action succeeds, you can choose to apply the failure effect instead. (For example, you may wish to do this when an attack deals no damage due to resistance.)",

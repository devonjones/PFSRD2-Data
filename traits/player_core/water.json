Creatures with this trait consist primarily of water or have a connection to magical water.  \n  \nPlanes with this trait are mostly liquid. Visitors who can\u2019t breathe water or reach an air pocket likely drown. The rules for aquatic combat (Player Core 437) usually apply, including the inability to cast fire spells or use actions with the fire trait. Creatures with a weakness to water take damage equal to double their weakness at the end of each round.",

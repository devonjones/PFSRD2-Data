    "text": "The weapon is suited for mounted combat with a harness or similar means. When mounted, if you moved at least 10 feet on the action before your attack, add a circumstance bonus to damage for that attack equal to the number of damage dice for the weapon. In addition, while mounted, you can wield the weapon in one hand, changing the damage die to the listed value. As a part of your action to Mount a creature, you can switch your grip on a jousting weapon to one-handed. After that, changing your grip takes the same actions described on page 268. If you dismount while wielding a jousting weapon onehanded, you can switch to using two hands as part of that action if you have a hand free at that point. If not, you\u2019ll still be holding the weapon in one hand, but not wielding it.",

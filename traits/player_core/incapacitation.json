    "text": "An ability with this trait can take a character completely out of the fight or even kill them, and it\u2019s harder to use on a more powerful character. If a spell has the incapacitation trait, any creature of more than twice the spell\u2019s rank treats the result of their check to prevent being incapacitated by the spell as one degree of success better, or the result of any check the spellcaster made to incapacitate them as one degree of success worse. If any other effect has the incapacitation trait, a creature of higher level than the item, creature, or hazard generating the effect gains the same benefits.",

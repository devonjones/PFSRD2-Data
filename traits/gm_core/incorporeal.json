    "text": "An incorporeal creature or object has no physical form. It can pass through solid objects, including walls. When inside an object, an incorporeal creature can\u2019t perceive, attack, or interact with anything outside the object, and if it starts its turn in an object, it\u2019s slowed 1 until the end of its turn. A corporeal and an incorporeal creature can pass through one another, but they can\u2019t end their movement in each other\u2019s space.  \n  \nAn incorporeal creature can\u2019t attempt Strength-based checks against physical creatures or objects\u2014only against incorporeal ones\u2014unless those objects have the ghost touch property rune. Likewise, a corporeal creature can\u2019t attempt Strength-based checks against incorporeal creatures or objects.  \n  \nIncorporeal creatures usually have immunity to effects or conditions that require a physical body, like disease, poison, and precision damage. They usually have resistance against all damage (except force damage and damage from Strikes with the _ghost touch_ property rune), with double the resistance against non-magical damage.",

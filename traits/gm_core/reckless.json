When performing a reckless action, the pilot must first attempt an appropriate piloting check to keep control of the vehicle, with the following effects. Resolve this piloting check before resolving the action itself.  \n  \n__Success__ The action occurs as described.   \n__Failure__ The vehicle moves its Speed in a straight line along its most recent heading, drifting up to 45 degrees at the GM\u2019s discretion, and becomes uncontrolled.",

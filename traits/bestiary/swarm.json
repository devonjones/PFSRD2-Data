Its size entry gives the size of the entire mass, though for most swarms the individual creatures that make up that mass are Tiny. A swarm can occupy the same space as other creatures, and must do so in order to use its damaging action. A swarm typically has weakness to effects that deal damage over an area (like area spells and <a aonid=\"150\" game-obj=\"Traits\">splash</a> weapons). Swarms are immune to the <a aonid=\"184\" game-obj=\"Traits\">grappled</a>, <a aonid=\"31\" game-obj=\"Conditions\">prone</a>, and <a aonid=\"33\" game-obj=\"Conditions\">restrained</a> conditions.",

Typically, only alchemists have the expertise to craft mutagens.   \n  \nA mutagen always conveys one or more beneficial effects (listed in the Benefit entry) and one or more detrimental effects (shown in the Drawback entry). Mutagens are polymorph effects, and a subsequent polymorph effect attempts to counteract an existing effect; the counteract check for a mutagen uses the item's level and a modifier equal to that level's DC \u2013 10.",

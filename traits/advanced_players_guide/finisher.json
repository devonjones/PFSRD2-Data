    "text": "Finishers are spectacular finishing moves that use your panache. You can use a finisher only if you have panache, and you lose your panache immediately after performing a finisher. Once you use a finisher, you can\u2019t use any actions that have the attack trait for the rest of your turn.  \n  \n Some actions that have the finisher trait also grant an effect on a failure. Effects added on a failure don\u2019t apply on a critical failure. If your finisher action succeeds, you can still choose to apply the failure effect instead. For example, you might do this when an attack deals no damage due to resistance.",

Once you use a finisher, you can't use any actions that have the <a aonid=\"15\" game-obj=\"Traits\">attack</a> trait for the rest of your turn.<br/><br/> Some actions that have the finisher trait also grant an effect on a failure. Effects added on a failure don't apply on a critical failure. If your finisher action succeeds, you can still choose to apply the failure effect instead. For example, you might do this when an attack deals no damage due to resistance.",

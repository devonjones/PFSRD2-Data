    "text": "This weapon can be used to Trip with the Athletics skill at a distance up to the weapon\u2019s first range increment. The skill check takes a \u20132 circumstance penalty. You can add the weapon\u2019s item bonus to attack rolls as a bonus to the check. As with using a melee weapon to trip, a ranged trip doesn\u2019t deal any damage when used to Trip. This trait usually appears only on a thrown weapon.",

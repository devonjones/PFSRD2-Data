    "text": "Spells with this trait grant you an action during the spell's effects, typically a reaction with a special trigger. They typically have a long duration, such as 24 hours. You can have only one spell with the contingency trait, or one _contingency_ spell, active at a time. If you cast another spell with the contingency trait or _contingency_, the newer casting supersedes the older.",

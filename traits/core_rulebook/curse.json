Curses are always <a aonid=\"103\" game-obj=\"Traits\">magical</a> and are typically the result of a spell or trap. Effects with this trait can be removed only by effects that specifically target curses. <br/><br/>Afflictions with this trait are manifestations of potent ill will. A curse either lasts a specified amount of time or can be removed only by certain actions a character must perform or conditions they must meet. A curse with stages follows the rules for afflictions.

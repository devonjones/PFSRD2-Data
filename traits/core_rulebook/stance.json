A stance lasts until you get knocked out, until its requirements (if any) are violated, until the encounter ends, or until you enter a new stance, whichever comes first. After you use an action with the stance trait, you can\u2019t use another one for 1 round. You can enter or be in a stance only in encounter mode.",

This uses the weapon\u2019s reach (if different from your own) and adds the weapon\u2019s item bonus to attack rolls as an item bonus to the Athletics check. If you critically fail a check to Trip using the weapon, you can drop the weapon to take the effects of a failure instead of a critical failure.",

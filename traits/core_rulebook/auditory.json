An action with the auditory trait can be successfully performed only if the creature using the action can speak or otherwise produce the required sounds. A spell or effect with the auditory trait has its effect only if the target can hear it. This applies only to sound-based parts of the effect, as determined by the GM. This is different from a <a aonid=\"147\" game-obj=\"Traits\">sonic</a> effect, which still affects targets who can't hear it (such as <a aonid=\"8\" game-obj=\"Conditions\">deaf</a> targets) as long as the effect itself makes sound.",

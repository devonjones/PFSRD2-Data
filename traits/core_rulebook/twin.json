When you attack with a twin weapon, you add a circumstance bonus to the damage roll equal to the weapon\u2019s number of damage dice if you have previously attacked with a different weapon of the same type this turn. The weapons must be of the same type to benefit from this trait, but they don\u2019t need to have the same runes.",

    "text": "An item with the ikon trait is a special item provided or created by an exemplar's divinity that is so tied to that exemplar that it can serve as a sacred vessel for their might. You gain three ikons at first level. Each ikon has a passive immanence ability and an activated transcendence ability. A feat with the ikon trait imbues one of your ikons with further capabilities. Whenever you gain a feat with the ikon trait, choose which of your ikons gains that ability; if you have multiple ikons that meet the feat's usage requirements, you can take the feat multiple times to apply its effects to another one of your ikons. These feats list what ikon they can be imbued into, and any number of them can be imbued into a single ikon.",

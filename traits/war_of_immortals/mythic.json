Feats with the mythic trait can only be taken by mythic characters, who are typically characters with a mythic Calling.  \n  \n Monsters with the mythic trait have access to a pool of Mythic Points and are particularly strong for creatures of their level. Many mythic monsters are either resistant or entirely immune to attacks from non-mythic creatures and weapons.  \n  \n Spells with the mythic trait require the expenditure of a Mythic Point in order to be cast, and items with the mythic trait require the expenditure of a Mythic Point in order to use their activated abilities.  \n  \n Weapons with the mythic trait overcome the resistances and immunities of mythic monsters.",

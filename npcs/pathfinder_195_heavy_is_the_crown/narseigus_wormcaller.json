They gradually learned of him in \u201cCult of the Cave Worm,\u201d the previous adventure, uncovering his plans to invade Rolgrimmdur, command Zogototaru, and break into the Sky King's Tomb. However, his self-serving objectives have made him many enemies, and the more the PCs uncover, the more of his embittered rivals they meet and might turn against him. Ultimately, he can only rely on his thralls.  \n  \n Yet Narseigus is so driven that he rarely glances back to notice the damage the PCs cause. By the time he does notice, it's too late. He's one of the final fights of the campaign, letting the PCs clash with Zogototaru and orchestrate Narseigus's comeuppance in one exciting scene.  \n  \n Narratively, Narseigus provides time pressure to what could otherwise be a casual expedition. After all, Taargick's tomb has survived over 9,000 years. What's another few months? But with Narseigus and his schemes, finding the tomb and thwarting the sorcerer become intertwined goals, keeping the PCs on the move.  \n  \n***Recall Knowledge - Humanoid* (*Society*)**: DC 38  \n***Unspecific Lore***: DC 36  \n***Specific Lore***: DC 33",

            "text": "Driven by political and magical ambition, this sorcerer has rediscovered a unique spellcasting art used to command cave worms.  \n  \n For all its emphasis on personal toil, hryngar culture rewards ensnaring others in a web of obligation and subservience. The more one's subordinates produce, the greater their master's take, so a hryngar who commands a mighty cave worm would be powerful indeed! At least this is what Narseigus believes.  \n  \n His early training to be a miner was interrupted by the emergence of his magical talents. When his arm momentarily and unexpectedly transformed into a tentacle that strangled his mentor, this one murderous act both spared him any education debt to his mentor and set him on a new career path... only for him to become indebted to magical masters who claimed most of his subsequent profits. In his limited spare time, he read avidly, always seeking new inspiration that could advance his career and livelihood.  \n  \n This research eventually unearthed worm calling, an obscure hryngar magical tradition that had fallen out of favor\u2014both due the psychological damage involved and the catastrophic consequences that might ensue should a cave worm break free. Knowing of no living worm callers (or at least unable to indebt himself to even more masters), Narseigus began piecing together the techniques from fragmentary sources. Yet the written word had limits. He increasingly realized that mastering this art required studying cave worms, learning their every instinct to attune his mind to theirs. Absconding without closing out his debts, he embarked on a decades-long expedition throughout Nar-Voth to follow cave worms, hone his spells, and swindle supplies as needed.  \n  \n And then he felt it: the telltale tremors of a cave worm, but massive beyond any he'd ever witnessed. He eagerly tracked the beast, witnessing its trail of destruction and discovering that this was the legendary crimson worm, Zogototaru. The creature's power captivated him. Why should he settle for controlling lesser worms when he could enthrall such a behemoth? Yet even though Zogototaru had left countless tunnels over the millennia, tracing her whereabouts proved challenging. Narseigus at last identified her lair, though getting to that lair would require traversing dwarven territory and excavating countless tons of stone. To his chagrin, he needed help.  \n  \n Fortunately, King Orgukagan of Hagegraf needed a miracle. With no great deeds to his name, the king knew his reign was unremarkable and his ongoing rule was equally precarious. Thus, when Narseigus proposed a military venture that would both crush Rolgrimmdur and help Narseigus seize a mighty asset to fuel future victories, the king eagerly bankrolled his operation. The sorcerer received everything he needed for his research, including privileged access to the king's ear. The operation's scope steadily expanded, earning Narseigus a coalition army, growing clout, and an impressive list of enemies who resented his rise to power.  \n  \n But for Narseigus, it would all be a means to an end. All that mattered was his magic.",

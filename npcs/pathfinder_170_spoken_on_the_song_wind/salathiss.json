Salathiss is nothing if not flexible, though, and he realizes he might have more to gain from impersonating one of Nantambu's nine influential magistrate-mayors. At first, Salathiss only sought this duplicity to regain access to the *Vesicant Egg*; eventually, he realized the true scope of authority that his impersonation could give him. Yet he's gotten far too deep into his role, and the serpentfolk under his command whisper that he's practically become a warmblood himself.  \n  \n Salathiss is the heroes' final foe in this adventure. Defeating him is the only way to keep Magistrate-Mayor Asanda safe and the Vesicant Egg secure. If Salathiss survives but can't continue his plans to recover the artifact or impersonate Asanda, he impersonates someone close to the heroes and plans a murderous betrayal. He keeps this long goal in mind, and it might be months before he strikes.  \n  \n***Recall Knowledge - Humanoid* (*Society*)**: DC 36  \n***Unspecific Lore***: DC 34  \n***Specific Lore***: DC 31",

            "text": "The subjugated lower caste of serpentfolk society, aapoph serpentfolk, are prone to strange mutations. Serpentfolk culture considers these mutations a sign of the aapophs' lesser status and think nothing of it\u2014 in fact, for the higher-ranking zyss serpentfolk these physical variations reinforce their twisted self-image of purity and superiority. While zyss serpentfolk can disguise themselves as other humanoids to achieve their goals, it's often seen as a duty and not a pleasure\u2014zyss prefer the purity of the zyss form to all else.  \n  \n It is rare, but a zyss can also be born with mutations. This is a closely guarded secret, only mentioned in shameful whispers. Any zyss born with a mutation is immediately killed, as their very existence flies in the face of zyss's so-called superiority.  \n  \n Salathiss would have been destroyed, except his strange mutation took many years to materialize. As he matured, he sometimes lost control of his form: the skin and bone on a part of his body would slacken and soften into a thick ooze for a few moments before snapping back suddenly and painfully into its original shape. The first few times this occurred caused a panic in Salathiss's colony; he was only spared death because his mentor, Thissal, was a serpentfolk of great power and influence. To punish Salathiss would invite Thissal's wrath, and no one wished to anger him. None even dared to tell him of his pupil's mutation, though the powerful zyss eventually learned of it on his own.  \n  \n Salathiss knew his mutation set him apart from other zyss. He prayed day and night for Ydersius to take it away, to cut it from his body just as the Headless King had his own body severed. Salathiss's prayers were never answered, but the daily ritual of constant prayer gave him what he needed most: focus. Salathiss learned that by focusing his mind when his body lost control, he could shape that body part into something else. He could mold his shape, such as turning his arm into a tool or a weapon.  \n  \n Prayer turned into practice. Salathiss realized that his mutation was an advantage if he kept it hidden and under control. He absorbed lessons in spycraft while he studied magic, convinced that he could succeed at one of the infiltration missions important to serpentfolk society. Though he was too young for such an important task, Thissal saw a dangerous mission as a good way to dispose of Salathiss without personal disgrace and gave his consent.  \n  \n Salathiss spoiled Thissal's hopes by exceeding all expectations placed on him. He infiltrated a human village and became well respected in the community. When he stole an ancestral relic from the village shrine, no one thought to suspect him. When he vouched for other serpentfolk infiltrators, the people welcomed them completely. Over a year of long-term infiltration, Salathiss corrupted the human village from within and left it a place of confusion and paranoia. Even Thissal had to agree that his prot\u00c3\u00a9g\u00c3\u00a9 had performed exceptionally and after silencing a few doubters with well-timed assassinations, Thissal declared Salathiss ready for more espionage work.  \n Salathiss developed a knack for studying \u201cwarmbloods,\u201d understanding their nature, and displaying empathy for those he would eventually betray. Though other zyss consider Salathiss's interest in warmbloods to be unseemly, his string of successes elevated his status and gave him the autonomy to determine his own assignments. He learned of the *Vesicant Egg*\u2014an artifact he incorrectly believed to be a magical snake egg\u2014and resolved to unlock its secrets to benefit all serpentfolk, and his own stature in particular. Salathiss wished to supplant Thissal, and a successful assignment of his own design could do just that.",

Like the heroes, Xin Yue has been trapped in the mindscape for the past 115 years, but due to her connection with Kugaptee, she has retained the memories of each passing cycle. She has kept tabs on the townsfolk of Willowshore, but after a century of repeated failures to break their own cycle, she discounted them as a threat to her work. As such, she was truly surprised when she received a vision from Kugaptee that showed the PCs opening the Wall of Ghosts.  \n  \n Despite her nearly skeletal, undead appearance, Xin Yue continues to foster her politeness; she doesn't hide her intent in any way. She has no personal grudge against the heroes. Although she might come across as reasonable, as long as Kugaptee's presence remains within the mindscape, she can't be reasoned with to stop her pursuits and will fight to the bitter end to achieve her goal.  \n  \n***Recall Knowledge - Undead* (*Religion*)**: DC 33  \n***Unspecific Lore***: DC 31  \n***Specific Lore***: DC 28",

            "text": "Xin Yue remembers all of their previous lives. They originally saw this ability as a blessing from the gods which allowed them to use their accumulated knowledge to better their station in life each time they died and were reincarnated. While they slightly preferred being reincarnated as a woman, because it matched their first body, they quickly grew to enjoy their lives in a man's body as well. Ultimately, to Xin Yue, the actual form of their body was unimportant as long as their soul remained whole.  \n  \n As a follower of Sangpotshi, each lifetime they lived saw them growing ever-nearer to enlightenment. They befriended long-lived spirits who were always happy for them to visit in their latest body. As their lives continued on, they eventually attained enlightenment. It was during what would have been her final reincarnation that she came to the Tan Sugi monastery and drew Kugaptee's attention. Though trapped in death below the Tan Sugi when Zhi Hui passed away, Kugaptee crept his influence into Xin Yue's dreams when her grief was most profound. Over the awful months to follow, the nindoru's influence over Xin Yue grew. In these dreams, Xin Yue and Kugaptee increasingly engaged in lively debates over the value of reincarnation, and over time, this corruption grew to the point that Xin Yue dedicated herself to the nindoru demigod, whom she had come to consider as the Lord who \u201copened her eyes to the frivolity of enlightenment.\u201d  \n  \n Xin Yue then turned her attention to the few remaining monks at the monastery and began to lure them over to the worship of Kugaptee. However, it wasn't until Xin Yue offered herself as a sacrifice to the fiend before the other monks' eyes\u2014only to be reincarnated into her current body\u2014that they converted as well. To them, Xin Yue had revealed that the Tan Sugi monastery wasn't a place for peace, but a cage-tomb that, if they could release its bound prisoner, would grant great power and rewards immediately, rather than waiting for countless reincarnations through a chance at something they might never even earn.  \n  \n Xin Yue's current body has the form of a human woman with a short build, shoulder-length cropped hair and a long black braid that hangs to her calves. She strikes fearful respect into her followers by saying terrible things with a cheery attitude and a kind smile on her face. Always polite even as she threatens and promises punishment, her politeness isn't a facade. Even while butchering her victims in the most prolonged and painful way possible, she smiles at them and earnestly thanks them for their sacrifice. When Governor Heh Shan-Bao's ritual slew the people of Willowshore and plunged the region into a mindscape, Xin Yue and her monks perished as well. However, they didn't return to life within the mindscape. Their proximity and devotion to Kugaptee kept them from life, and they've spent each cycle of the past 115 years as undead. To Xin Yue, this new body is a shameful and horrific burden, and she only hopes that by helping Kugaptee to achieve what he desires\u2014using the incarnation of his old enemy's body, now the sugi tree that grows over his grave, as the raw building blocks of a new living body\u2014that she too shall be reborn into a new body. She has little interest in what kind of body she might attain, just that it be one of living flesh.",

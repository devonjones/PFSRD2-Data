                    "text": "When the heroes first encounter Kendley, she's been incorporated into the *convergence lattice*. The convergent effect identified her as the most capable creature in the hive mind and centered itself on her as the \u201cauthority,\u201d drastically augmenting her power. Unfortunately, the lattice's goal of forced unification for all puts her at odds with the heroes, and she does everything she can to incorporate the heroes into the hive mind.  \n  \n As with all the Eagle Garrison rangers caught up in the convergence lattice, Kendley is simply being controlled. Killing her certainly lessens the immediate threat the *convergence lattice* poses, but if the heroes can remove the effect or destroy the lattice without killing her, she regains the behaviors and abilities she had before the lattice empowered her (without the convergent abilities, Kendley is a 12th-level creature). If returned to her own senses, Kendley can serve as an ally and source of reliable information. She's familiar with the region and she knows Sarvel and his entourage (consisting of several dozen xulgaths, over a dozen saurians, and several demons) passed by the garrison and headed into the Vale of Aroden. She's also heard many rumors about what might be found in the Vale, although she's never seen it herself.  \n  \n***Recall Knowledge - Humanoid* (*Society*)**: DC 49  \n***Unspecific Lore***: DC 47  \n***Specific Lore***: DC 44",

            "text": "The captain of the Eagle Garrison is a skilled, experienced ranger in her own right, but the influence of the *convergence lattice* imakes her a deadly foe and a threat to the region she's supposed to be monitoring\u2014all in the name of unification.  \n  \n Kendley Nathrael was born and raised in a small community in Nirmathas along the southwestern border of the Fangwood. She spent a significant part of her youth evading military incursions from Molthune. She sought out mentorship and opportunities to continue learning over the years, slowing rising through the ranks, informal as they were, of the Nirmathi militia. Her life was dangerous, thrilling, and deeply rewarding.  \n  \n Then the hobgoblins came. The Ironfang Invasion swept indiscriminately across southern Nirmathas and Molthune, razing villages and driving the survivors into the forest. Kendley found herself leading a desperate group of refugees to the Nirmathi capital of Tamran, where the survivors found refuge and Kendley found herself working alongside other militia leaders to respond to the sudden and dire hobgoblin threat.  \n  \n Higher-ranking militia members in Nirmathas took note of Kendley's abilities, so when strange reports started trickling down from the Nirmathas-Lastwall border, they assigned Kendley to scout and evaluate the situation. She traveled north along Lake Encarthan and up the Tourondel River, hoping to make a circuit of the nation, but that circuit was abruptly cut short when the Whispering Tyrant obliterated Vigil, Lastwall's capital. Overnight, Kendley went from scouting a region for danger to fleeing from it, once again leading a band of refugees into the Fangwood for safety. For several weeks, she managed to keep her ragtag followers alive in the face of the undead horrors rising up across the devastated nation, and when she stumbled across the Knights of Lastwall making their own way to Absalom, she insisted they take along her group of survivors. To her surprise, those survivors insisted she remain with them; with the region in shambles, she agreed to accompany them to the City at the Center of the World.  \n  \n Absalom completely overwhelmed Kendley, and so she sought out the only structure she was familiar with: the military. She enlisted in Absalom's First Watch, and the skills she had built over her years in Nirmathas helped her quickly rise through the ranks. It was only a few months before she was promoted to a captain's post, but despite her success, Kendley still found the city uncomfortable and oppressive; she missed the cool hills and dense forests of her homeland terribly. A few days after mentioning this longing in passing to a few guard colleagues, however, her commanding officer came by with a question: Had Kendley heard of the Eagle Garrison?  \n  \n The opportunity seemed too good to be true. A position outside of the confines of Absalom's walls, high in the foothills of the nearby mountains. A role centered around the scouting and reconnaissance work she had excelled at in Nirmathas. Even her command of the Sylvan language\u2014learned through her interactions with the Fangwood's fey\u2014would serve her well communicating with the noble giant eagles allied with the Eagle Garrison. Moreover, the garrison's present captain was looking to retire once a suitable replacement had been found. Perhaps, the officer suggested, that role might appeal to her?  \n  \n She accepted immediately.  \n  \n Captain Nathrael has been posted at the Eagle Garrison for just under 6 months. Though she operates within a larger hierarchy, the bureaucracy is a distant thing and she rarely has to deal with it. The mountains are different from the woodlands of her home, but the work is largely the same, and she's found a kinship with the other rangers similar to what she had with her old colleagues further north. Having lived through several crisis events, she gauges everything with a level head and a keen eye that her subordinates have rapidly come to trust and respect.",

More than anything, Parsus's true enemies are their family, particularly their father Drakar and eldest sister Rhyst. They dream of revenge daily and, though they would never admit it, below this hatred, some part of Parsus still yearns for acceptance from their family.<br/><br/> Though a vile individual with disturbing sensibilities, the true Parsus is little more than a pawn in Anjelique and Ibrium's grand plan. Parsus was primarily following orders when they took over the Tinwound Hydroplant and slaughtered its caretakers, and the necromancer stoically explains as much when the player characters apprehend them in the factory's blood-soaked engine room. If Parsus survives the adventure, they hold no particular grudge against the characters, sensing a kinship with them, as they are themselves, after all, only following orders. Regardless, Parsus has no wish to confront Anjelique or Ibrium, recognizing the duo has thoroughly outplayed them. The only way to convinced Parsus to aid the characters' pursuits is by ensuring that doing so would mean snubbing Parsus's most hated adversary, their father Drakar.<br/><br/><b><u><a aonid=\"563\" game-obj=\"Rules\">Recall Knowledge - Humanoid</a></u> (<u><a aonid=\"14\" game-obj=\"Skills\">Society</a></u>)</b>: DC 37<br/><b><u><a aonid=\"563\" game-obj=\"Rules\">Unspecific Lore</a></u></b>: DC 35<br/><b><u><a aonid=\"563\" game-obj=\"Rules\">Specific Lore</a></u></b>: DC 32"

            "html": "Parsus grew up on a large estate in the outskirts of the Axan Woods of Geb, in a lonely and twisted landscape of haunted trees, inscrutable ruins, and misty forest trails. Parsus and their six older siblings are all dhampirs, half-vampire progeny born from a vampire and mortal union. Their father is Drakar Fademore, a powerful vampire and Blood Lord of Geb\u2014one of 60 undead leaders who oversee the dread empire's unholy administration.<br/><br/> From an early age, Father Fademore taught his brood to revile magic users, and he instilled in the children an unquenchable thirst for arcanists' blood. Under the patriarch's guidance, Parsus and their siblings participated in \u201cblood hunts.\u201d On such occasions, the family would gather a host of vampiric yeth hounds and chase spellcasting victims through the woods for days at a time. Unlike their elder siblings, Parsus possessed little skill with martial arts and enjoyed neither combat nor hunting. Instead, their passions drew them to study magic and science. Parsus's father looked on these pursuits with disdain, viewing them as paltry hobbies that paled in comparison to the honor, glory, and bloodshed of a spirited hunt. The Fademore family had earned its status through bloodshed during Geb's great war with Nex, specializing in hunting and killing the wizards of Quantium. Instead of learning to hunt wizards, like a true Fademore, Parsus was interested in becoming one.<br/><br/> After letting Parsus's obsession grow for years, Drakar eventually decided to draw them into the family hunts by force. He took Parsus deep into the Axan Woods and left them there, telling them to live or die as they wish, but not to return home without a fresh kill. Rather than giving into their feral instincts, Parsus instead studied the stars to navigate their way home and developed a magical snare to kill a forest dryad. They returned home triumphant, believing they proved the value of knowledge over instinct. Drakar, however, was displeased.<br/><br/> For the next decade, Drakar's tests and challenges for Parsus grew ever more brutal. Through it all, Parsus refused to abandon their love of knowledge and magic. Each test only served to further strengthen their resolve and honed their skills until, one day, Parsus discovered they had become a potent necromancer. Parsus's siblings had meanwhile become master hunters and earned their father's favor, while Parsus was ultimately cast aside and forgotten. In time, their craving for approval turned into deep hatred for the entire Fademore family.<br/><br/> Several years ago, Drakar turned over finances of the Fademore estate to Rhyst, Parsus's eldest sister. Ever the pragmatist, Rhyst quickly decided to save her father from any further embarrassment and sent Parsus away from the estate. If a new war between Nex and Geb were to break out, the city of Alkenstar to the north would be a ripe ground for investment, Rhyst explained to a seething Parsus. The necromancer had no choice but to board a Gebbite barge pulled by massive skeletal crocodiles (fruits of their own childhood projects) and set out for Alkenstar. Once in the city, they half-heartedly looked for ways their family might profit from war, but primarily focused on studying the city's fascinating clockwork wonders. Eventually, a shieldmarshal named Anjelique discovered Parsus and decided the promising spellcaster could help her further her own violent schemes."

On a critical failure, you also take an amount of fire damage equal to your level. As the innovation's creator, you can spend 10 minutes retuning your innovation and making adjustments to return it to functionality, at which point you can use unstable actions with that innovation again.  \n  \n To take an unstable action, you must be using your innovation (for example, wearing an armor innovation or wielding a weapon innovation). If you have a minion innovation, some unstable actions are taken by the minion instead of you. In these cases, only the minion can take that action, and the minion needs to have been Commanded that turn to take the action. If you critically fail the flat check, the minion takes the damage instead of you.  \n  \n Some actions have an Unstable Function entry, which you can use to add the unstable trait for a bigger benefit. If you're unable to use unstable actions, you can still use the action normally, but you can't use the unstable function.",

On a failure, the innovation malfunctions in a spectacular (though harmless) fashion, such as a belch of smoke or shower of sparks, and it becomes incapable of being used for further unstable actions. On a critical failure, you also take an amount of fire damage equal to your level. As the innovation's creator, you can spend 10 minutes retuning your innovation and making adjustments to return it to functionality, at which point you can use unstable actions with that innovation again.  \n  \n To take an unstable action, you must be using your innovation (for example, wearing an armor innovation or wielding a weapon innovation). If you have a minion innovation, some unstable actions are taken by the minion instead of you. In these cases, only the minion can take that action, and the minion needs to have been Commanded that turn to take the action. If you critically fail the flat check, the minion takes the damage instead of you.  \n  \n Some actions have an Unstable Function entry, which you can use to add the unstable trait for a bigger benefit. If you're unable to use unstable actions, you can still use the action normally, but you can't use the unstable function.",

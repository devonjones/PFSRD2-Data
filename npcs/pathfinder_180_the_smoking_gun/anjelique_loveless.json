            "text": "Decades ago, an Osirian paladin named Entarish and a river hag named Gris Nightspittle fought a deadly battle inside a forgotten pharaoh's tomb. Both escaped from the conflict gravely injured, and after that day the two became mortal enemies hellbent on undoing the work of the other. After years of conflict, Gris eventually concocted a devious plan to bring Entarish to his knees. In the ruins of flooded temple beneath a hunter's moon, Gris gave birth to a changling infant and left the child on Entarish's doorstep. Gris knew that foolish Entarish, in his weakness, would care for the cursed babe.  \n  \n Even though he suspected Gris was tied to the child, Entarish played into the hag's plot. He named the infant Anjelique and served as her father and mentor, raising her to follow a virtuous path in spite of her wretched heritage. Yet for all Entarish's noble efforts, Anjelique possessed a cruel disposition and wicked temper. When she came of age, Gris approached the young woman in the dead of night and revealed the truth of her birth. Gris then commanded Anjelique to kill her adopted father and join the hag's side.  \n  \n To Gris's surprise, Anjelique refused her mother's grim commandment. In a rage, Gris gathered her most powerful minions and finally slew Entarish, overwhelming the paladin while Anjelique was away. When she discovered her father had been slain, Anjelique recovered his holy sword and set out to find Gris. The cunning hag thought Anjelique had finally given in to her evil birthright and returned home, but instead she avenged her fallen parent by soaking his sword in Gris's blood and claiming the hag's blackwood staff.  \n  \n After fulfilling her vendetta, Anjelique wandered through the world alone, aimless and in search of meaning. Although she constantly carries Entarish's virtuous words in her thoughts, her troubled past and cursed birthright cast an unholy pall across her mind.  \n  \n Finally Anjelique resolved to walk a righteous path in the name of her father by joining Alkenstar's shieldmarshals. She commissioned the grand duchy's best gunsmith to forge Entarish's blade into an enchanted silver pistol and Gris's staff into a magical long gun. For nearly a century, Anjelique brought law and order to the wilderness around Alkenstar. The long years wore on her, however, and she slowly lost touch with the short-lived humans that surrounded her. Now, she's torn between upholding lawful ideals and dealing out bloody punishment to those she deems unworthy. Her silver pistol still possesses some of Entarish's grace and frequently misfires when she attempts to use it for an evil act. Often, while away from prying eyes, she will draw the pistol on her captured fugitives and fire, allowing the gun to decide if the person is worthy of life.  \n  \n Anjelique's primary motivation is power. As an elf, she's been a shieldmarshal for nearly a century and has outlived her original peers. Because of her lengthy tenure and ruthless pursuit of her own personal brand of justice, few question her continued presence on the force. Anjelique has spent years advocating for a larger Alkenstari army, though she made little progress on this front until just recently. She believes that by arranging a series of disasters, she can shock the city's political elite into action. By way of this scheme, Anjelique hopes to disgrace the current shieldmarshal command structure while simultaneously rising through the ranks to assume control of a new army of conscripted shieldmarshals. Ultimately, she wants to use this army to bring order to the lawless frontier beyond Alkenstar's walls, which she believes is what Entarish would have wanted.",

After making a successful ranged Strike against a creature stuck with a planted charge, Anjelique can choose to shoot a bullet through the charge, dealing normal damage and detonating the charge immediately. A creature can use an Interact action to find and remove a planted charge from itself or an adjacent creature. These pyronite charges have the infused trait and are inert until activated by Anjelique."

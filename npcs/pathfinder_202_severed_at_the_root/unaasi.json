They're a powerful spellcaster with knowledge of the occult and skill at performing rituals.  \n  \n Midway through the campaign, when Unaasi sets Corazal on fire, Unaasi becomes an immediate threat. The PCs finally face off against Unaasi in Gloaming Arbor, as Unaasi turns their manipulations and charisma onto Avathrael in hopes of winning the dragon's aid for the Wildwood Lodge. Whether Unaasi wins or loses the bid for Avathrael's favor, their hatred drives them to fight the PCs.  \n  \n***Recall Knowledge - Humanoid* (*Society*)**: DC 38  \n***Recall Knowledge - Plant* (*Nature*)**: DC 38  \n***Unspecific Lore***: DC 36  \n***Specific Lore***: DC 33",

            "text": "Unaasi's earliest memory is being hunted for food. The memory didn't originally belong to them, but to that of an earlier life\u2014an earlier time before their current life cycle, when life was harder and ghorans had yet to adopt a humanoid form. It was a potent memory, one of the few that didn't fade even after centuries of renewals and rebirths. Unaasi was \u201cborn\u201d in Nex and lived there generation after generation, stretching back to the very creation of the ghoran species.  \n  \n Like many ghorans, Unaasi has fought hard to survive, challenging persecution and predation alike. Yet, with each successive generation, fewer and fewer ghorans survived. Their never-ending battle to secure a future for ghorans left Unaasi tired, yes, but it especially left them furious.  \n  \n Unaasi left Nex for the first time 10 years ago. They traveled far, but through it all, they had only one destination in mind: the Verduran Forest, homeland of Ghorus and, perhaps, a place where Unaasi could unlock the power to help their people prosper.  \n  \n They were disappointed. While they found greater acceptance than in Nex, there was no special connection or magical answer like they'd sought. Ghorus's legacy was lost, and most of the people in the forest were descendants of Ghorus's ancient enemies or were fey too capricious to be worthwhile companions. Each disappointment felt like an indignity. Each dead end in their investigation felt less like a clue lost to history and more like a secret purposefully destroyed by Andoran and Taldor. In time, Unaasi's anger blossomed into violence. They stalked and hunted the loggers and foresters who hacked and sawed, just as Unaasi and their kin had been hunted. Using cunning, deception, and magic, they took their vengeance piece by piece. Yet, never did they think they would achieve retribution. Not until Ruzadoya.  \n  \n When Ruzadoya Swiftmane became leader of the Wildwood Lodge, Unaasi did something they hadn't done in lifetimes\u2014hope. More than that, Ruzadoya inspired confidence in them. There would be no more hiding in the dark shadows, no more pleasant smiles and pretty lies, no more magic spells whispered under breath\u2014Unaasi didn't have to fear. With Ruzadoya, they could win. They would drive the scourge of humanity from the region, together, starting with Andoran and Taldor.  \n  \n Unaasi rose through the Wildwood ranks swiftly, becoming a well-respected, cutthroat agent. Their efforts to convince the people of the Verduran Forest to ally with the Wildwood Lodge proved more fruitful than most thanks to their silver tongue and talent with mental magic. Unaasi is among the first to volunteer to secure Ghorus's legacy on Ruzadoya's behalf, and they succeeded in collecting information and numerous relics. The loss of the *Cythbikian staff* to the Rootweft Lodge drove them to seek vengeance upon the one they perceived as responsible: Corazal, whom they set aflame.  \n  \n Unaasi was rewarded for their efforts and ritually transformed into one of Ruzadoya's Chosen. Now, empowered by their connection to the Plane of Wood, they seek to secure the aid of Avathrael Realmshaper, who can help Ruzadoya perfect her ritual, and set Ruzadoya on the path to surpassing Ghorus\u2014a leader worthy of Unaasi's reverence who would understand the plight of their fellow ghorans.",

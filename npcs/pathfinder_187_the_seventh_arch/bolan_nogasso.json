            "text": "Druidism draws some adherents because they love nature\u2014and others because they hate people. Bolan Nogasso has always been the latter. Bolan grew up in the logging camps of Andoran, the son of parents with too many offspring and too little affection. Shy and scrawny, he found himself a target of constant abuse from burly loggers' children, including his own siblings. He took to spending as much time as possible hiding in the woods. There, in the quiet among the trees, he could fnally let his guard down. In time, he managed to befriend local fey, including pixies and brownies. Bolan began to pray that he'd turn out to be a changeling\u2014anything but the child of boorish humans.  \n Time and again, the same story would play out: Bolan would return to a favorite grove and fnd it clear-cut, his fey friends nowhere to be found. As he grew older, he flled out, and he used his new strength to fght these atrocities. Yet the loggers\u2014 those same childhood chums who'd spent their lives bullying him\u2014only laughed as they bloodied his nose. Hopeless, he tried to drink his troubles away. It was on one of these benders that he frst heard of Sevenarches. In Sevenarches, people served nature, rather than the other way around. Guards called Oakstewards reminded citizens of the delicate balance between the needs of humanoids and those of plants and animals. Bolan set out immediately, vowing not to rest until he was apprenticed to these sagacious druids. It worked: Bolan excelled in his training and soon became a full Oaksteward. With his knowledge and magic, he felt closer to the natural world than ever\u2014 while also appreciating the distance his status put between him and Sevenarches' deferential citizens. Yet his joy was short-lived. Bolan soon realized that, for all their talk of balance, the Oakstewards actually put humanoid interests frst. He began to clash more and more with his superiors, eventually seeing them as just another petty hierarchy that was more concerned with international politics than truly safeguarding the natural world. He volunteered to patrol the nation's borders, venting his merciless frustrations upon anyone he caught sneaking into Sevenarches. And then came the Missing Moment. Through the Seventh Arch, Bolan saw a tranquil, natural world where humanoids were no more important than blades of grass. He leapt eagerly through the portal. Though (like everyone else) he has no memory of what occurred in his time through the gate, he returned with a new determination to realize the perfect vision he'd glimpsed. Adding to his conviction were strange powers he'd somehow gained from the Missing Moment: magic which allowed him to control the human-despoiled remains of plants\u2014the wood in buildings, the fbers in fabric. To Bolan, this vegetative necromancy was a sign that he'd been chosen as an avatar of nature's vengeance.  \n Soon afterward, Bolan received his frst visit from a terrifying fey which called themself Kaneepo the Slim. Desperate for an ally and already favorably inclined toward fey, Bolan agreed to do whatever the fgure wanted. In exchange for a simple favor from Bolan\u2014 namely, stealing the sacred key to the Seventh Arch\u2014 Kaneepo promised to help Bolan not only overthrow humanoid civilization, but to destroy it entirely so that the natural world could heal.  \n  \n **Campaign Role**  \n Though the primary antagonist for the frst chapter of the adventure, Bolan is ultimately a patsy\u2014a desperate zealot who's become a pawn in Kaneepo the Slim's wicked game. Kaneepo has no problem with the rebel Oaksteward's genocidal goals. The fey only needs Bolan to steal the Shadewither Key, with which Kaneepo can expand their territory and pursue their own vengeance against the elves of Kyonin. Bolan is at once a tragic fgure and a dangerous foe, quick to spout proclamations about civilization's unchecked growth. Although he cares little for the other Oakstewards who've joined his cause, he genuinely feels for his fey allies, and he's surprisingly tolerant of their shenanigans.",

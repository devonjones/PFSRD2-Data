If the triggering action was an attack, it retroactively becomes a critical failure. The engineer must use an Interact action to reset the device before it can be used again. |\n| 2  | **Backfire** The device violently explodes, disabling it and dealing 1d6 bludgeoning damage for every 2 levels the engineer has in a 5-foot burst centered on the device. The device is broken until the engineer Repairs it. |\n| 3  | **Off-Target** If the triggering action was a targeted attack, the attack instead targets another creature (other than the engineer) within 10 feet of the intended target, determined randomly by the GM. If no such target exists, the attack misses. |\n| 4  | **System Reset** A burst of feedback momentarily shuts down all the engineer's devices. The engineer can't use attacks or abilities granted by any personal engineering device, potentially including movement speeds, until the start of their next turn. |\n| 5  | **Overheat** The overstressed device generates a wave of intense heat. The device burns the engineer for 4d6 fire damage and 2d4 persistent fire damage, with a basic Reflex save. The DC is equal to the engineer's Fortitude DC. The engineer can Release the item before rolling to improve their degree of success on the save by one step. |\n| 6  | **Delayed Reaction** The device fails to function, having no apparent effect.

(These flat checks continue even if the mechanic is dead or otherwise can't take turns.) On a failure, the item explodes, dealing damage equal to the item's level to all adjacent creatures and ending the upgrade. \n* **Overheat Weapons** If the item would deal damage, it deals an additional 1d6 fire damage. This increases to 2d6 if the item is 8th level or higher.\n* **Pressured Plating** The item gains a +3 status bonus to its Hardness and gains temporary Hit Points equal to double its level that last for 10 minutes.\n* **Propelled Boost** If the item has a Speed, the item gains a +15-foot status bonus to Speed."

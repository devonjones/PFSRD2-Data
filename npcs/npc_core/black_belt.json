On a success, the demoralized creature is off-guard until the end of their next turn.

If the mixed martial artist rolls a critical failure to Feint, they get a failure instead. If they successfully Feint, they can use Stance Shift as a free action. Unlike other stances, in this stance the mixed martial artist can't make Strikes.  \n **Defensive Side Kick** [@] **Trigger** A creature within the black belt's reach uses a move action; **Effect** The black belt makes a fist Strike designed to intercept and create distance. This Strike does not count towards the black belt's multiple attack penalty, and the black belt's multiple attack penalty doesn't apply to this Strike. On a successful hit, the target is pushed 5 feet away. **Kiai!** [-] **Frequency** once per turn; **Requirements** The martial student attempts a Strike; **Effect** The martial student shouts to startle their adversary.

The item is usually a juggernaut mutagen, or quicksilver mutagen. This ability can't be used again until the martial artist has time to acquire and hide a new mutagen. Some martial artists use concealed small vials, but others hide a syringe or soak the alchemical liquid into a garment they can put in their mouth.  \n **Illegal Bite** [#] The martial artist makes an Athletics check against a target's Fortitude DC to bite them in a vulnerable area. On a success, the martial artist deals 2d6 piercing damage (or double on a critical success).  \n **Sand In Your Eye** [#] (visual) The martial artist Feints.

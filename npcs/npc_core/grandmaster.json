If the mixed martial artist rolls a critical failure to Feint, they get a failure instead. If they successfully Feint, they can use Stance Shift as a free action. Unlike other stances, in this stance the mixed martial artist can't make Strikes.  \n **Defensive Side Kick** [@] **Trigger** A creature within the black belt's reach uses a move action; **Effect** The black belt makes a fist Strike designed to intercept and create distance. This Strike does not count towards the black belt's multiple attack penalty, and the black belt's multiple attack penalty doesn't apply to this Strike. On a successful hit, the target is pushed 5 feet away. **Kiai!** [-] **Frequency** once per turn; **Requirements** The martial student attempts a Strike; **Effect** The martial student shouts to startle their adversary.

The item is usually a juggernaut mutagen, or quicksilver mutagen. This ability can't be used again until the martial artist has time to acquire and hide a new mutagen. Some martial artists use concealed small vials, but others hide a syringe or soak the alchemical liquid into a garment they can put in their mouth.  \n **Illegal Bite** [#] The martial artist makes an Athletics check against a target's Fortitude DC to bite them in a vulnerable area. On a success, the martial artist deals 2d6 piercing damage (or double on a critical success).  \n **Sand In Your Eye** [#] (visual) The martial artist Feints.

This entry indicates how many Interact actions it takes to reload such weapons. This can be 0 if drawing ammunition and firing the weapon are part of the same action. If an item takes 2 or more actions to reload, the GM determines whether they must be performed together as an activity, or you can spend some of those actions during one turn and the rest during your next turn.  \n  \nAn item with an entry of \u201c\u2014\u201d must be drawn to be thrown, which usually takes an Interact action just like drawing any other weapon. Reloading a ranged weapon and drawing a thrown weapon both require a free hand. Switching your grip to free a hand and then to place your hands in the grip necessary to wield the weapon are both included in the actions you spend to reload a weapon.",

In the strongest areas of a void plane, they could take moderate or even major void damage at the end of each round. This damage has the death trait, and if a living creature is reduced to 0 Hit Points by this void damage and killed, it crumbles into ash and can become a wraith (see Monster Core).",

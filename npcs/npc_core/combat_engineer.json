Using this action again ends any previous formation, and the troop can also use this action to revert to its default formation, ending any benefits and drawbacks. \n* **Loose** Members of the troop fan out to cover more ground. **Benefit** Any weaknesses the troop has to area and splash damage are suppressed. **Drawback** Enemies' saving throws against the troop's damaging effects are one degree of success better than they roll.\n* **Marching Column** This formation traverses long distances more rapidly. **Benefit** The troop gains a +10 foot circumstance bonus to all its Speeds. **Drawback** The troop is off-guard and takes a \u20132 penalty to Reflex saves.\n* **Turtle Shell** The troop interlocks their shields. Only a group with shields can use this formation. **Benefit** The troop gains a +2 circumstance bonus to AC against ranged attacks and to Reflex saves. **Drawback** The troop takes a \u201310-foot penalty to all its Speeds.\n* **Wedge** The troop aligns itself behind a powerful commander. **Benefit** The troop chooses an adjacent allied creature without the troop trait to fall in behind. Each time the chosen creature Strides, the troop follows as a free action, Striding to keep the chosen creature adjacent. **Drawback** The troop loses some of their autonomy.

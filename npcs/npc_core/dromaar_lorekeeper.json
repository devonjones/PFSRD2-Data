Their heavy limbs and broad, almost bow-legged stances combine with a tendency to slouch forward to create an almost contradictory set of circumstances where an orc can tower over other humanoids while simultaneously staring them in the eye. These features, alongside a tendency to scar easily, can make them seem quite intimidating.  \n  \n The half-orc dromaars, most commonly born of unions between orcs and humans, are often tested even more harshly than their full orc kin, but those who endure these tests can rise to positions of authority. \u201cAn orc can have what an orc can hold\u201d is a saying that not only applies to an individual's ability to secure their own destiny and position, but is also likely the root of orcs referring to their communities as holds.",

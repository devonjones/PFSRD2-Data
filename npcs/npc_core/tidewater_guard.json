Because lizardfolk settlements are typically constructed partially underwater and partially above, they have need of defenders who can guard from attacks in both environments.  \n  \n The special spaulders tidewater guards wear set them apart from other lizardfolk warriors. These protect their shoulders from cutlass and axe strikes, and might be constructed of dragon scales, turtle or giant chiton shells, lacquered wood, or even sea urchin tests. The recipe for the special resin iruxi armorers apply to harden these spaulders is a closely guarded secret, and each iruxi community's supply of the resin is small, precious, and closely guarded.",

Lizardfolk likewise have longstanding traditions of religious worship and astrology, with eyes on the past, the future, and the stars whenever they make a large decision. Their long history has taught them to be patient in all things, though this has seen them losing ground to hastier peoples in modern times.  \n  \n Lizardfolk refer to themselves as \u201ciruxi,\u201d though they have taken their common moniker among other peoples in stride. Most of their settlements are entirely communal, with hatchlings raised by anyone with the time and temperament for such a role. Iruxis dwell and thrive in all tropical and temperate biomes, but they are most at home in swamplands, coastal regions, and river lands. They are talented swimmers, and many of their major cities are partially submerged to take advantage of this fact, causing them to often be overlooked by others.

They're always useful to have when a plan inevitably goes wrong because they can quickly craft the perfect tool needed to get out of even the stickiest predicament.  \n  \n Every now and again, someone tries to hire a gadgeteer to perfect a single design to replicate it and make more permanent versions of their thrown-together gadgets. This effort is often in vain, as even the most talented gadgeteers are unlikely to perfectly replicate a design they made in the moment, even with the same materials. In fact, when put on the spot, they will likely create a functional gadget differently every time, even if they have access to the same material. This process makes duplication nearly impossible.",

The device is broken until the engineer Repairs it. |\n| 3  | **Off-Target** If the triggering action was a targeted attack, the attack instead targets another creature (other than the engineer) within 10 feet of the intended target, determined randomly by the GM. If no such target exists, the attack misses. |\n| 4  | **System Reset** A burst of feedback momentarily shuts down all the engineer's devices. The engineer can't use attacks or abilities granted by any personal engineering device, potentially including movement speeds, until the start of their next turn. |\n| 5  | **Overheat** The overstressed device generates a wave of intense heat. The device burns the engineer for 4d6 fire damage and 2d4 persistent fire damage, with a basic Reflex save. The DC is equal to the engineer's Fortitude DC. The engineer can Release the item before rolling to improve their degree of success on the save by one step. |\n| 6  | **Delayed Reaction** The device fails to function, having no apparent effect.

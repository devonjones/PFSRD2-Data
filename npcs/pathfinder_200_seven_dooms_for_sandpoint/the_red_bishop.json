If he can orchestrate a great calamity or deadly disaster to take out his enemies, he'll do that instead of confronting them in battle. Yet at the end of this adventure, when he makes contact with his latest \u201cproject\u201d (the PCs), he's likely to be forced into a fight.  \n  \nWhen combat is unavoidable, the Red Bishop fights with as many allies as possible, so that he can remain at range and cast spells against foes. Phantasmal killer is one of his favorites\u2014those who are targeted by this spell endure realistic visions of horrific, world-ending disasters that seem to focus the brunt of their devastation on the victim. When fighting with allies in this way, he deactivates his Portentous Gaze, but he'll activate it at once if he's surrounded or reduced to fewer than 150 Hit Points, regardless of any minions or allies he might frighten. In melee, the Red Bishop uses his longsword with frightening effectiveness. Those who try to engage him up close might expect a weak spellcaster, and they might not live to regret that mistake. Typically, the Red Bishop makes two Strikes with his sword, then either moves to a better position or Focuses his Gaze on a foe.  \n  \nWhile \u201cSeven Dooms for Sandpoint\u201d assumes the Red Bishop does not survive, if the mothman cleric does escape, he can become a dangerous recurring enemy\u2014especially since once defeated and forced to flee, he relies more and more on working from afar, manipulating events to make life horrible for his enemies rather than seeking another rematch in battle.  \n  \n***Recall Knowledge - Aberration* (*Occultism*)**: DC 42  \n***Unspecific Lore***: DC 40  \n***Specific Lore***: DC 37",

            "text": "This mothman priest of Pazuzu does not share his actual name with anyone, in part because the name itself cannot be spoken aloud\u2014only conveyed via an unsettling telepathic sending. To those he manipulates and torments, he is known only as the Red Bishop.  \n  \n The Red Bishop first came to the Lost Coast at the turn of the century in 4700 ar. Originally drawn from distant lands by the lure of his demonic patron's influence over the region, the Red Bishop was delighted to find not only an ancient shrine devoted to Pazuzu hidden within the rock of Chopper's Isle on Sandpoint's outskirts, but a much more ancient and powerful legacy in the depths of the Pit itself. Here, he knew a thin spot existed between the Material Plane and the Abyssal realm of High M'vania, where Pazuzu ruled. Yet an ancient ward kept the potential rupture in reality in check. Unable to directly undo this ward, and indeed, preferring long, slow corruption and cruelty to swift pain and immediate ruin, the Red Bishop settled into the region to begin a plan that would take over two decades to come to fruition.  \n  \n Sandpoint's fortunes grew darker the day the Red Bishop arrived. Life there was already hard, but once the Red Bishop began to manipulate events, things grew undeniably worse. It was the Red Bishop who ensured that local eccentric Jervis Stoot would find and become corrupted by the statuette of Pazuzu that would give rise to Chopper's murder spree. It was the Red Bishop whose nightmare sendings and whispered poison caused so many in Sandpoint to act awfully toward Nualia, eventually resulting in the devastating fire that nearly burned the Sandpoint Cathedral to the ground. And while the Red Bishop himself was not directly responsible for the rise of Runelord Karzoug, his subtle manipulations certainly helped to spread the influence of the minor runewell of wrath hidden below Sandpoint so that certain powerful locals became more prone to cruelty.  \n  \n For the next 20 years, Sandpoint has endured one tragedy after another. And while the grief caused by the Red Bishop's influence amused him, it was but a side effect of his primary goal. For such events were the best way to cultivate the very tools he needed to see to the destruction of Sazzleru's ward in the Pit. Adventurers were the Red Bishop's goal, adventurers who weren't direct agents of the Abyss but, as with so many mortals, could be manipulated into doing the Red Bishop's bidding.",

Unless otherwise noted, the battle form prevents you from casting spells, speaking, and using most manipulate actions that require hands. (If there's doubt about whether you can use an action, the GM decides.) Your gear is absorbed into you; the constant abilities of your gear still function, but you can't activate any items.

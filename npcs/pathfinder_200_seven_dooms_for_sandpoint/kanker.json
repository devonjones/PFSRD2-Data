He suspects the Red Bishop has his own hidden agenda, but the idea of returning to Sandpoint after all these years to rule his former home is too tempting for the ghast to resist, and so he has made his temple and its resources available to the Midnight Dawn and introduced Tiluatchek to his pawn, Aliver Podiker. Now he bides his time, waiting for the right moment to strike.  \n  \n This adventure assumes Kanker largely remains in the shadows until the PCs reach the lowest level below the Pit, where he becomes the most significant threat they'll face. In combat, Kanker prefers to fight at range with his alchemical bombs but won't shy away from melee if he can avoid being surrounded by foes. His typical attack is to use Toxic Effluvium, strike with his flail, and then strike with a claw\u2014he prefers to avoid using his jaws attacks on living foes, since he regards ghastly undeath as a gift and is choosy on who and what he potentially inflicts ghast fever upon.  \n  \n If the PCs don't defeat Kanker during their first encounter with him, he won't hesitate to gather new allies through the use of his rituals.  \n  \n***Recall Knowledge - Undead* (*Religion*)**: DC 40  \n***Unspecific Lore***: DC 38  \n***Specific Lore***: DC 35",

            "text": "Endinyon Greethe was Sandpoint's first alchemist. After arriving in the bustling new town a mere 2 years after it was founded in 4666 ar, the talented Nidalese expatriate set up shop near the southern waterfront and achieved moderate success, providing the townsfolk with a ready source of herbal remedies, alchemically enhanced fishing bait, and other helpful elixirs and tinctures. Yet Endinyon kept his biggest source of income a secret, for it was this that had gotten him run out of Nidal\u2014he was an accomplished body snatcher. For the next three years, he supplied corpses to disreputable sorts in Magnimar to the south and smaller villages like Galduria, Wolf's Ear, and even Ravenmoor to the north. But when a particularly large and complicated order to Riddleport involving bodies that weren't quite dead yet backfired, the citizens of Sandpoint rose up and burned his shop to the ground. Endinyon fled into the smuggler's tunnels underneath the city, traveling away from Sandpoint where his enemies were searching high and low for him. Ironically, he followed the smuggler's tunnels into a network of ghoul warrens and eventually ended up below Pauper's Graves to the east of town: a site where he'd stolen many bodies in the past. Unfortunately, those thefts had particularly enraged the ghasts who still dwelt there. Endinyon died, captured and tortured by the ghasts whose \u201cpantry\u201d he'd raided too often, only to rise as a ghast himself. Over the next several years, the man who was once Endinyon reinvented himself into something new\u2014a ghast called Kanker. It was in the deeper ghoul caves below Pauper's Graves that he first discovered Kabriri's faith, and it wasn't long before he converted. Eventually, Kanker's enterprising nature and leadership skills helped him rise to power among the undead who dwelt below the Sandpoint hinterlands. Yet he always harbored anger and a need for revenge against the people of Sandpoint for ruining what he had started to build.  \n  \n Kanker left the other ghasts, explored the Darklands below the Lost Coast, and eventually found his way into the chambers surrounding the Pit. There, he discovered the ancient temple that occupied its lowest reaches, and he knew he'd found his new calling. He began the task of clearing out the temple to be one appropriate to the demon lord of ghouls and secrets kept by the dead, and in time he was joined by a small following of like-minded Kanker ghast cultists\u2014most of whom also bore grudges against the ghouls of the Lost Coast and the citizens of Sandpoint alike.  \n  \n For years, Kanker was content to study and worship, but during a trip through the Sandpoint hinterlands to forage for alchemical supplies, a chance meeting with a looming presence who possessed haunting red eyes gave the ghast a new direction. His encounter with the Red Bishop inspired Kanker, making him realize that he deserved more than just an ancient crypt temple in the hinterlands. He and his ghasts deserved Sandpoint, and if Kanker would aid the Red Bishop by assisting another group who had become active in the region, the Midnight Dawn, the dooms that would soon come to Sandpoint would give Kanker all he needed to turn the town into his own domain of undeath.",

She used it to sniff out her target's location and shattered the columns of the building he was hiding in, flushing him out for a very public killing blow. The alchemically granted ability lingered as she met with Blood Mistress Jakalyn to report her success, during which Saviya smelled something she never detected before: elven blood.  \n  \n This intrigued the high priest, for while Jakalyn was human, the faint scent of elf exuding from her was, to Saviya's enhanced senses, unmistakable. Jakalyn's mysterious longevity was well-known, of course, but the more Saviya watched and observed, the more she began to think that, somehow, Blood Mistress Jakalyn had inherited elven longevity. This vexed Saviya greatly, for she had designs on Jakalyn's position and had previously intended to take the very elven route of patience\u2014simply outlive her human superior and then step into her vacant role.  \n  \n The realization that Jakalyn may well outlive her forced Saviya's hand, and she began to slowly recruit members to a conspiracy eventually meant to dethrone Jakalyn and secure the god-given right to rule the Red Mantis from Achaekek.  \n  \n By the time the PCs finally catch up to Saviya, she's close enough to her goal that not only can she smell it, she can taste it. As the favored agents of Jakalyn, the PCs are as much Saviya's enemies as their leader is, but when the PCs encounter her in Elysium, her frustration at being so close to success forces her to finally commit a likely fatal mistake\u2014she challenges the PCs directly.  \n  \n***Recall Knowledge - Humanoid* (*Society*)**: DC 49  \n***Unspecific Lore***: DC 47  \n***Specific Lore***: DC 44",

            "text": "Saviya's association with the Red Mantis began during her days as a mate on the pirate ship *Storm Shark* over 100 years ago. The infamous, cruel commander of the ship was a man named Captain Dargi\u2014as notorious a pirate as ever prowled the Shackles. As a member of the crew, Saviya followed Captain Dargi's commands to loot, pillage, and sink many ships of the Chelaxian Navy, all while worshipping Besmara, the Pirate Goddess as a faithful priest. The *Storm Shark* was very successful and very brutal; they took pride in leaving none alive after their raids, and Saviya came to delight in the dread she inspired when name-dropping the ship.  \n  \n Like many far-ranging pirate captains of the Shackles, Captain Dargi kept a berth in Ilizmagorti. Whenever the *Storm Shark* visited this port, the crew always abided by the laws of the Red Mantis, even if doing so was a challenge for a bloodthirsty pirate like Captain Dargi, who (while at sea) often derided the assassins and made bold claims of some day pillaging Ilizmagorti and making the city his own. Saviya initially found the captain's bravado intimidating, even a bit inspiring. But each time they sailed into Ilizmagorti and she saw the power, respect, and fear afforded to the Red Mantis among the city's citizens, her respect and fear of her blowhard captain dwindled, replaced by derision. She knew better than to voice her growing dissatisfaction with Captain Dargi, of course, but as her interest in the Red Mantis assassins grew, she increasingly kept an eye out for an opportunity to make her move.  \n  \n One day, Captain Dargi met with a Rahadoum cruiser to fence stolen booty, as he had done many times in the past. Saviya happened to overhear the captain and the fence discussing their wares: secrets about Mediogalti Island's defenses. Saviya knew this betrayal would certainly be discovered and lethally punished the next time their ship sailed into Ilizmagorti, so when the *Storm Shark* arrived there a few months later, Saviya swiftly but secretly reported her captain's misdeeds to the Red Mantis and begged to be allowed to help with his assassination. The Red Mantis agents were impressed and agreed, with one requirement: they insisted that if she came along, she would be the one to kill Captain Dargi. Saviya eagerly accepted, and for several days she met in secret with her assassin contacts to learn their ways as best she could in preparation for her big chance. When the moment came, Saviya relished the kill, striking at her captain with the sawtooth saber she'd smuggled aboard, and then using her magic to break every bone in Dargi's body so that when death finally came, it did in glorious agony. From that day forward Saviya was a faithful devotee of Achaekek instead of Besmara.  \n  \n Saviya could have claimed the *Storm Shark* as her own and served as a captain, but instead she offered the entire crew a choice\u2014they could be marooned on an island far from any shipping lane and take their chances, or they could return with her to Ilizmagorti as servants of He Who Walks in Blood. Many of the crew chose to become marooned, only to learn (much to their horror) that this simply changed the venue and method of their offering to Achaekek, for the island Saviya had chosen was infested with immense deadly mantises who made quick work of the doomed crew.  \n  \n Saviya served He Who Walks in Blood dutifully for the next several decades, starting by converting those of the *Storm Shark* crew who accepted her offer. Eventually, she was asked to join the priesthood at the Pagoda of the Mantis in Ilizmagorti. Over the next several decades, she rose in the ranks and became the current high priest. She's been a member of the Vernai for the past two decades\u2014which, as it turns out, is plenty of time for her to revert to her old ways of plotting her commander's downfall.",

This development makes it easier for the PCs to bolster the town's defenses in the coming months, but at the cost of being able to efficiently prepare food stores for the coming winter.  \n  \n Once the town of Willowshore is safe at the start of Chapter 3, the PCs can attempt to interact with Granny Hu using the Influence subsystem. An influence encounter with Granny Hu is a 3rd-level challenge, and an influence round with Granny Hu takes 1 hour. If any attempt to Influence Granny Hu results in a critical failure and the PCs have fewer than 5 Influence Points with her, she uses her So Have You Heard? ability against that PC soon thereafter.  \n  \n***Recall Knowledge - Humanoid* (*Society*)**: DC 30  \n***Unspecific Lore***: DC 28  \n***Specific Lore***: DC 25",

She pulled them and herself through to adulthood by working as a racketeer before securing a position as an imperial soldier guard. Her siblings remained in the criminal world but retained loyalty to their sister and acted as informants and financiers to help her climb the ranks of the city watch.  \n  \n Planning ahead for the day when she grew old and frail and simply wanted to enjoy the wealth and power she'd amassed, Ban-niang volunteered to be an inaugural village guard captain in the \u201cbackwaters\u201d that was Willowshore when Lung Wa started its lumber operations. Occupying the position for over two decades, Ban-niang retired in 7088 ic but, by that point, had grown fond of the town she'd once dismissed as a backwater and stayed on in her retirement. She has cultivated her image of \u201cGranny Hu,\u201d pretending to let age mellow her ambitions, but in fact, she knows many folks' dark secrets and isn't afraid to use this knowledge to manipulate others.",

Thus, she plays an important part in introducing them both to the Wildwood Lodge and the culture of druids and forest creatures who call the Verduran Forest home. With her vast stores of knowledge and a dagger-sharp intellect that belies her physical ponderousness, Emorga should quickly become a vital resource to the PCs as they are thrust first into the role of defenders of the peace and later into that of rebels against a dangerous new regime. Although she typically can't accompany or directly assist the PCs in their efforts, she provides invaluable assistance by taking on the role of a planner and organizer who can remain at their base of operations, leveraging her connections and knowledge to lay the groundwork for future endeavors, while the characters travel around and get things done.  \n  \n Emorga has now served on the Lodge council for the better part of a millennium and, in her centuries of life, she has witnessed the rise and fall of many leaders and political factions both within and without. Her dire concern over widespread strife in the aftermath of the Greenwood Massacre and the implications of Ruzadoya's takeover of the Lodge in Chapter 3 should therefore impress upon the characters the gravity of the situation: these truly are threats the likes of which the Verduran Forest has never seen before.  \n  \n Although Emorga is an accomplished spellcaster and an imposing physical presence, she rarely involves herself in combat unless there is an immediate threat to herself or those she is charged with protecting. Even then, she typically acts to protect or empower her allies rather than to inflict harm on her enemies. Outside of combat, she is always willing use her spells, rituals, and other abilities to aid the characters whenever she can.  \n  \n***Recall Knowledge - Animal* (*Nature*)**: DC 36  \n***Unspecific Lore***: DC 34  \n***Specific Lore***: DC 31",

            "text": "Emorga All-Seer is an ancient being who has faithfully served as counselor to Wildwood Lodge leadership for centuries. Even Emorga herself is uncertain of her true age, having already grown to full size when she was discovered living on the Isle of Arenway almost four thousand years ago by refugees of the doomed Goroth Lodge after Taldor crushed it. Over centuries, as the isolated sect grew into the mighty Wildwood Lodge and its influence spread across the Verduran Forest, the immense tortoise continued her peaceful existence, mostly ignoring the tiny creatures that had settled around her.  \n  \n The ever-increasing number of druids flocking to the island were enamored with the enormous but gentle creature, eventually adopting her as a sort of mascot. As centuries became millennia, she also became something of a living historical archive, her massive shell scutes having absorbed and recorded centuries of environmental data like the rings of an ancient tree. Not all these records are formed naturally; Emorga's shell is also covered in thousands of etchings that include elaborate decorative symbols and patterns alongside ancient historical accounts, secret messages recorded in long-forgotten druidic ciphers, and archaic primal spell formulas dating back to the dawn of the tradition. To the druids who shared her island home, Emorga would come to serve both as a symbol of the Wildwood Lodge's endurance across the centuries, and as a living repository of knowledge from the generations that had come before.  \n  \n By 2281 AR, Taldor's ongoing military expansion and voracious appetite for lumber exerted growing pressure on the region, leading inhabitants to turn to the Wildwood Lodge for protection\u2014ultimately leading to its adoption as the de facto governing body for all of the Verduran Forest. Thanks to the tireless efforts of Lodge druids working in concert with the ancient conrasu Corazal, extensive deforestation and violent clashes were both kept to a minimum and the forest remained in a state of tenuous peace for centuries, finally culminating in the signing of the Treaty of the Wildwood in 3841 AR. Seeking the region's wisest to act as advisors, the druids sought counsel from its oldest and wisest inhabitants to guide their decisions, among them an ancient and benevolent nature spirit calling itself only the Wildwatcher. The Wildwatcher accepted, and as its first advice, it suggested the Lodge recognize an ancient and overlooked ally: Emorga, the great tortoise that had lived alongside them since the earliest days of their order. Utilizing the ritual of *awakening*, the Wildwatcher granted Emorga sapience so that the Lodge might prevail upon her centuries of accumulated wisdom, humbly inviting the great tortoise to join the Lodge as a respected counselor to its leadership.  \n  \n Today, some 750 years later, Emorga continues to faithfully serve the Lodge, the druids, and her community. Over centuries of studying soothsaying and divination, she has also become as adept at peering into the future as recalling the distant past, earning her the appellation of \u201cAll-Seer\u201d and making her an invaluable member of the council that informs all major Wildwood Lodge decisions.",

The scoundrel sees little harm in taking credit for any activities attributed to the organization, provided that intervention from local law enforcement seems unlikely. They are likely to take on high-profile jobs for the Firebrands just for the thrill of later recounting the narrow scrapes of their adventure.  \n  \n The charming scoundrel is as dramatic in combat as outside of it, often darting from opponent to opponent and disorienting foes with flashy swordplay. If a battle is going well, the scoundrel will often shout taunts at slow-footed opponents or encouragement to allies. While prideful and competitive, the scoundrel is a pragmatist at heart and will opt to add a tale of a cunning escape to their repertoire if the odds seem stacked against them.",

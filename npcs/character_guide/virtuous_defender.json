Styling themselves the Shining Sentinels, they see themselves as a bulwark against the further spread of the Tyrant's influence. When not rallying troops to battle against their sworn foe or protecting villages from undead incursions, these knights travel the Inner Sea in hopes of recruiting other righteous souls to fight against the undead hordes.  \n  \n Many Shining Sentinels are servants of good deities, such as Iomedae; in battle, they turn their god-given powers against their foes. These virtuous warriors put the safety of their companions before their own and often hold defensive positions to protect their allies.",

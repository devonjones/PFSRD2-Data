The Society's treacherous missions require all types of adventurers, from seasoned combatants to ruin delvers and experts in the occult. Some field agents are highly specialized, filling a single role in a larger group of Pathfinders, while others branch out into a broad range of abilities.  \n  \n This field agent seeks the thrill of discovering lost treasures from the Inner Sea's many ancient ruins. She scouts ahead for her team, keeping an eye out for enemies, traps, and other dangers. In fights, she is cautious and practical, preferring to stay mobile and out of sight. She sneaks in for a finishing blow when victory is certain.",

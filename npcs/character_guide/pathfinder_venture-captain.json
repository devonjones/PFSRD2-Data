An individual venture-captain has overcome numerous challenges, and each has countless stories to tell\u2014and the scars to go with them. Each venture-captain maintains a lodge somewhere in the Inner Sea, where Pathfinder agents can rest, share stories, and set out on new missions. The venture-captain assigns these missions themselves, and they can draw on the significant resources of the Pathfinder Society\u2014as well as any local allies they have\u2014to ensure the missions' success.  \n  \n This venture-captain operates a lodge that also serves as a tavern. His interest in epic tales led him to join the Society, and he gladly shares these stories with interested parties. Opportunistic field agents can gain the venture-captain's favor by recovering unique and valuable liquors. The venture-captain hopes to one day publish a Pathfinder Chronicle of his own.",

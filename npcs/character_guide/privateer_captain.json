Privateers work for their own profit and reputation, of course, but they also commit themselves to keeping the sea-lanes free from navies that strive to enforce land law on the unbounded waves. Tyrants and slavers are their favorite targets, and many a greedy colonizer or trafficker in flesh has been sent to the bottom of the sea after the captain liberated their cargo. Generally, however, the privateer captain is willing to spare prisoners so that they might be ransomed and spread tales of Firebrands' actions across the region.  \n  \n The privateer captain is often at the vanguard of boarding parties. Many call on the power of the fickle goddess Besmara to strengthen their crew in battle and sanctify each shipboard raid. As at home in water as on deck, a privateer captain will gladly leap into the sea to pursue a foe or rescue a fallen crewmate. Though the privateer captain might run under a false flag or attempt to deceive a foe before battle, they generally honor agreements to surrender and make a point to keep their word, particularly when dealing with other Firebrands.",

Though the horrific events that led to the fall of Lastwall shook their faith in the traditional hierarchy of the Knights, they hardened their resolve to hunt all undead from the face of Golarion. These Crimson Reclaimers still see the Whispering Tyrant as their primary foe, but they can be found in many of the most haunted regions of the world, living off the land and hunting the restless dead.  \n  \n While heroism and fervor for their cause still burns in their heart, veteran reclaimers have lived long enough to lose their taste for tales of courtly valor and valiant last stands. They have learned the value of caution and thus engage their enemies from range and use terrain to their advantage. They are quick to strike back at enemies that harm their allies, knowing staunch teammates are essential in the face of the world's many horrors.",

His irrepressible curiosity and keen mind for chemistry earned him few friends among the goblins, even though his firebombs were always a source of good fun. When the Gullcrackers were killed and reanimated as zombies, Gristleburst took on the lonely, sad task of putting down each one of his former kin. He now wanders the world as an alchemist-for-hire, just as eager to investigate unusual mysteries as he is to set things ablaze.  \n  \nGristleburst is an unreliable ally. He's quick to make friends\u2014particularly because he's otherwise all alone in the world\u2014but he frequently pursues his own ideals without consulting his allies and hurls his bombs with reckless glee.",

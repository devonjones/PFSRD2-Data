In truth, these claims are an exaggeration, and the embarrassed noble fell victim to one of Duhgik's traps and simply embellishes the threat to save face.\n* While traveling through the woods, the heroes come across a series of traps, each more dangerous than the last. A voice high in the trees tells them to flee or face the wrath of the \u201cvery-big-mean dragon\u201d that protects the forest and its inhabitants.\n* Duhgik meets the heroes while on a trip into town to buy supplies and sell some of her snares to hunters she trusts to use them honorably. She asks them to help her with a particularly aggressive magical beast that has been avoiding her snares and killing all the wildlife near her home.\n  \n  \n***Recall Knowledge - Humanoid* (*Society*)**: DC 32  \n***Unspecific Lore***: DC 30  \n***Specific Lore***: DC 27",

Duhgik that the environment matched her own green scales well, and has since become an expert at hiding among the big-big trees.  \n  \n When Duhgik found the cruelty of her old kobold tribe reflected in the cruelty of hunters and poachers in the forest, she set out on a personal mission to help the critters of the woods by disarming poachers' snares and setting up some of her own.

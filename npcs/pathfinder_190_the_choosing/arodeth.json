Arodeth has chosen one of her apprentices, a man named Raflin Dorrum, as her pledged follower. Arodeth has seen perhaps too much of fate already, and she's willing to give up her card, *The Rakshasa*, more easily than others who have received them.  \n  \n Arodeth hasn't forgotten how she benefitted from the kindness of adventurers in the past. If the PCs also treat her with kindness and respect, she might shift in alignment from lawful evil to lawful neutral at the adventure's conclusion.  \n  \n***Recall Knowledge - Humanoid* (*Society*)**: DC 42  \n***Unspecific Lore***: DC 40  \n***Specific Lore***: DC 37",

            "text": "Lord Garron of Cheliax was a wealthy noble and devoted follower of Aroden. Aroden's death in 4606 ar hit him doubly hard: he both lost the god he revered, and he lost his home when House Thrune rose up and seized power in Cheliax. Lord Garron became an exile, fleeing to Absalom with a significant portion of his wealth. There, he started anew as a mercenary, joining and then leading a group he called the Band of Blades.  \n  \n Garron's life changed when he discovered a tome of prophecies, the *Book of 1,000 Whispers*. He believed Aroden's death had been a cosmic error, but by ensuring the prophecies in the *Book of 1,000 Whispers* came to pass, he believed he could correct the error and Aroden would return. The last of the prophecies in the book was to take place in 4714 AR, and the aging Garron knew he wouldn't see the glorious return come to pass. But his daughter, named Arodeth in honor of the dead god, would. Garron made sure to instill the importance of his work in her.  \n  \n Arodeth grew up believing that fate held a special place for her, and she took to her father's cause with enthusiasm, preserving her father's fortune as leader of the amoral Band of Blades mercenary company. Outwardly, she styled herself as a vapid, pampered aristocrat who only directed the mercenary company she'd inherited on a whim. In truth, she used the Band of Blades as a cover for a mystery cult she led called the Harbingers of Fate. Mercenaries travel the world, after all, particularly when they'll work for any petty tyrant, so it was relatively simple to use them to help enact the cult's plans. There were so many prophecies to orchestrate that Arodeth had to rely upon trusted lieutenants to carry them all out (one of whom\u2014Lord Drustan of Cheliax, the son of her father's friend\u2014 would ultimately prove less than reliable). The Harbingers of Fate achieved success after success, and the Band of Blades prospered.  \n  \n Then time ran out in 4714 AR, and Arodeth's lifelong purpose proved fruitless. Aroden didn't return, and the prophecies went unanswered. Rather than face the enormity of her failure, Arodeth enacted a desperate gamble to steal a powerful artifact from the Pathfinder Society to turn local time backward to just before Earthfall, when Aroden still lived as a human, and pull him to the present. However, the mission proved disastrous, leading to the deaths of many in the Harbingers of Fate and Band of Blades. Arodeth herself would've been lost in the past and perished during Earthfall if not for the efforts of some kind-hearted Pathfinders who took mercy on her and returned her to the present.  \n  \n Today, Arodeth believes herself to be a failure twice over. The Harbingers of Fate disbanded, and she was left with only the Band of Blades. Rather than lose this group, too, Arodeth threw herself into leading them. She shed the ruse of an insipid aristocrat and now makes bold decisions to preserve the company and ensure its prosperity. She has faced too many failures and is determined not to lose again.  \n  \n Arodeth is an elderly woman who works daily to keep her mind keen and muscles strong. Her dark hair has turned gray, and her face is weathered, but she retains the soft features and kindly eyes that encourage others to open up to her. Although she still likes to dress in aristocratic fashion, she never appears without a rapier at her side and is usually in the company of her mercenaries.",

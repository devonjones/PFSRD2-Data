            "text": "Devil worshippers took control of Cheliax in the Thrune Rebellion, but diabolists are just as duplicitous with each other as they are to their enemies. Thirty years ago, when he was a child, Drustan's family was exiled from Cheliax on charges of \u201cinsufficient loyalty to her Infernal Majestrix Abrogail Thrune\u201d and stripped of their holdings and possessions. Instead of enduring the punishment, his family fled to Molthune, taking a significant portion of their valuables and living as nobles-in-exile. Drustan's family never forsook their infernal loyalties, hoping to return to Cheliax some day after the rule of House Thrune had ended.  \n  \n Drustan was raised with a strong sense of familial pride and diabolism, a combination that fed his narcissism and cruelty. He was able to abuse those around him just because of his wealth, and when his parents couldn't protect him from consequences, he turned to summoning devils to enforce his will. He became well known in certain infernal circles for inspiring terror and hopelessness in others. Devils gleefully aided him, not because they hoped to acquire his soul\u2014it was already as good as theirs, anyway\u2014 but to perpetuate the evil he was enacting in the world.  \n  \n When Drustan heard about the Harbingers of Fate, he was quick to join, using his family's history with the society's founder, Lord Garron, as leverage to bypass the normally lengthy process of proving oneself in the Band of Blades before ascending to the secret heart of the organization. Privately, Drustan believed that bringing back Aroden would mean that the once-dead god would owe him, and what better way to demonstrate domination over the universe than to have a god beneath your heel? Drustan played the part of a devoted, even unctuous member, rising to become one of Lady Arodeth's trusted lieutenants.  \n  \n When the Harbingers of Fate failed and the group disbanded, Drustan insisted he would let the past go and focus on the Band of Blades, where Arodeth badly needed him. He also agreed that, like others in the Harbingers of Fate, he would destroy his copy of the *Book of 1,000 Whispers* as penance and to symbolize a new beginning. This was yet another smooth lie, and he destroyed a cleverly constructed decoy of the book instead. Drustan never intended to give up his efforts to bend fate to his whim and had increasingly become obsessed with an even more ancient tool of prophecy than the book\u2014the harrow.  \n  \n After selling Arodeth on a mission to Varisia to recruit fresh Blades and scout out new opportunities, Drustan used the task as a cover to delve into the mysteries of the harrow. During this time, he had his first fateful encounter with the harrower Raven Nicoletta, and from her, the efforts of the Harrowing Three to create the *Deck of Destiny*. He joined her and helped to found the Unmatched, then convinced Arodeth to join him in Varisia, where she and the Band of Blades took up residence in the Storval Stairs; he hoped to take command of the mercenary group to aid his true goal. Then disaster struck, and the *Deck of Destiny* was scattered after a failed attempt to steal the cards, leaving Drustan with the single card he managed to swipe\u2014*The Fiend*\u2014before the Unmatched were forced to flee the norns' wrath.  \n  \n With the *Deck of Destiny* scattered, Drustan scrambled to recover as many of the cards as he could before the norns reclaimed them. Upon learning that three other cards manifested among his previous allies in the Band of Blades, Drustan only grew more convinced of the divine mandate of his goal. Working with clues provided to him by Raven (who continued to seek the cards as well), he sent one of his agents to Absalom to follow up on rumors of a small concentration of cards found there while he investigated a bounty hunter in the Kodar Mountains, who Raven believed had discovered *The Mountain Man*. Drustan succeeded in this quest and is currently on his way back to the Storval Stairs, where he expects to meet with his agent Vharnev before attempting a coup to seize control of the Band of Blades.  \n  \n Drustan is a tall, striking man, with straight black hair and an arresting gaze. He accents his armor with pentagrams, spikes, and expensive furs to try to \u201cinfernally rededicate\u201d the armor, which only creates a more terrifying look. Apart from his intimidating appearance on the battlefield, Drustan is a pleasant and talented conversationalist with a natural gift toward music. Yet, he deploys this personality only rarely, as he prefers to use his brutish minions and cunning devils to advance his plans.",

He recruited the Lightkeepers to enter the tournament and gather information on the other teams, and he also orchestrated Mogaru's attack on Goka to force a direct confrontation with Hao Jin on his own demiplane, the one place he stood a chance of defeating her. He orchestrates his Hungry Ghost Tournament on his demiplane island both as an insult to Hao Jin and to delay the party so he has time to recover from his duel with the Ruby Phoenix. Once the player characters reach the *Glass Lighthouse*, Syndara begins to see them as Hao Jin's successors and will stop at nothing to utterly destroy them.  \n  \n***Recall Knowledge - Monitor* (*Religion*)**: DC 54  \n***Unspecific Lore***: DC 52  \n***Specific Lore***: DC 49",

Though all axiomites strive to bring order in a chaotic world\u2014many through acts of creation\u2014Syndara took this a step further than his fellow inhabitants of Axis, not by crafting clever artifices, but by creating entire pocket realities of mathematically precise shapes and spirals. For many years, Syndara was the premier artist of Axis, until one day a ruby-haired sorcerer arrived at the city's gates.  \n  \n The two were immediate kindred spirits. But time passed and Syndara grew jealous of Hao Jin's innate gifts. His creations grew crueler and more depraved, his \u201cart\u201d seeking to shock as if to make up for a self-perceived deficit in ability. Hao Jin realized that while Syndara had always desired to cultivate order from chaos, he also wished to impose his own idea of how the world should be on others\u2014by force if necessary. After a great struggle, Hao Jin defeated her old friend. She could not bear to destroy him, though, and instead imprisoned him within his own demiplane-in-progress, the *Glass Lighthouse*. She further secured him by placing the *Glass Lighthouse* in her own demiplane, the *Hao Jin Tapestry*, which amplified the effects and duration of his imprisonment. Syndara spent eons trapped in a flow of turbulent time, consumed with thoughts of revenge. Now that he is free from his cage, Syndara seeks to humiliate and kill Hao Jin then claim her magic for himself.",

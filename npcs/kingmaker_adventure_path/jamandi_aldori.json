She quickly mastered the art of the Aldori sword, and over the years has become one of Restov's most well-known swordlords, in part due to her skill in dueling, but of late as a result of her increasingly obvious pushes to expand Restov's power in directions that minimize reliance upon the rest of Brevoy. Beyond organizing the push into the Stolen Lands and her desire to foster a new ally to the south, she hopes some day to found additional dueling schools beyond Brevoy's borders where the Aldori style can be taught\u2014a pursuit that not all of her peers equally approve of.  \n  \n Characters who earn Jamandi's trust and support can unlock access to the Aldori duelist archetype at your option.",

Times remained tough for the boy until the night he had the dream.  \n  \n A blindingly beautiful woman approached him, challenging him with a simple question: Why did he defer to his father when he himself deserved the honor of rule? The woman gave him a magical helm crafted from the skull of a stag, then promised him that taking command from his father would be but the first step toward commanding an army of his own.  \n  \n When he woke, he assumed his dream was just that, but then he saw that he still clutched the helm his nocturnal visitor had gifted him. So when his father, drunk and angry, came at him that afternoon, the boy fought back, beating his father to within an inch of death before setting out on his own into the wilderness.  \n  \n In the following years, the Stag Lord gathered outcasts and criminals to his side, commanding them with the same brutality he'd learned from his father. He also inherited a fondness for drink from his father, and today spends much of his time in a drunken haze.",

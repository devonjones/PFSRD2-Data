            "text": "Armag was not born with that name, but today, he fully believes he is the legendary ancient leader reborn to lead the Tiger Lords back to an age of glory. He has long forgotten his birth name, as well as much of his childhood, as his brief but overwhelming recent experiences forced these memories out of his mind to make room for bloodlust, an addiction to violence, and obsession with mayhem. Only his worship of Gorum remains today, yet even this has been corrupted\u2014tainted by the fell influence of the Sisters of the Bloodshot Eye. Little remains in Armag's mind today save for a desire to conquer, to wield the mighty greatsword *Ovinrbaane* in battle, and to revel in the glory of war. While he claims to be the reborn ancient hero, his \u201cmemories\u201d of this previous life are largely hallucinations and fantasies implanted by the influence of his weapon.  \n  \nArmag himself appears as a muscular human with unruly brown hair, a full beard, and an expression that seems incapable of any other visage than anger, wrath, or fury.",

Instead, Armag becomes confused and continues to fight.

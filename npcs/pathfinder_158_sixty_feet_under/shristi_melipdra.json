            "text": "Before Shristi Melipdra served as a commander for Absalom's Sleepless Suns, he was a renowned martial arts champion within his homeland, the island nation of Jalmeray. In their youth, Shristi and his twin sister Rashmivati Melipdra both strove to become the most talented martial artists of their generation. When they came of age, they were each accepted to train at different sects of Jalmeray's Houses of Perfection; Shristi studied within the Monastery of Untwisting Iron, while Rashmivati became a disciple at the Monastery of Unblinking Flame. The two siblings trained hard, each determined to prove themself as the other's greatest rival, and they both swiftly rose through the ranks of their respective schools.  \n  \n Eventually, Shristi and Rashmivati earned the opportunity to represent their monasteries in the Houses of Perfection's famed Challenge of Sky and Heaven. The twins both performed admirably, displaying mastery of martial skill and potent ki techniques, as well as an uncanny intuition in the martial arts and the mentally and spiritually oriented challenges. Finally, the time came for the final bout in which Shristi and Rashmivati were destined to face each other. Shristi's powerful blows and implacable defense evenly matched Rashmivati's fierce grabs and debilitating joint locks, so it was perhaps unsurprising that simple bad luck proved the deciding factor.  \n  \n Shristi overestimated the length of his punch and left his arm vulnerable to one of his sister's devastating counter throws. Rashmivati grasped her brother's wrist and elbow in preparation to throw Shristi out of the ring. As she stepped into the throw, however, her foot landed on a single flower bud\u2014the remnant of a bouquet thrown from the audience\u2014and slid out from under her. Her body twisted painfully as she fell, and she dislocated her hip and shoulder. Rashmivati could not continue the fight and forfeited to her brother, who claimed victory for his monastery.  \n  \n Though Rashmivati never participated in another martial arts tournament, she has still proven herself a beloved and capable rival for her brother. To this day Rashmivati often says she will meet Shristi in the Challenge of Sky and Heaven once more, so she can claim her own champion's medallion. In truth Rashmivati has no such plans; she merely uses every opportunity available to take pride in her brother's accomplishments and to encourage him to do the same.  \n  \n A few months after that ill-fated Challenge of Sky and Heaven, Rashmivati set off to explore the wider world, and Shristi joined her, both out of a concern for his sister's safety and an eagerness to see the same sights she sought. Sailing from the Garundi coast to the icy northern waters of the Lands of the Linnorm Kings, the twins had many amazing exploits over the course of a nearly two-decade-long adventuring career. Rashmivati developed interests in archaeology and history, which ultimately led her to the Pathfinder Society, where she wrote and published several chronicles detailing the sites and wonders that she and her brother had uncovered. Shristi, though he shared his sister's love of adventure, was of a less scholarly bent. He saw little purpose or benefit to membership in the Society; instead, he preferred to spend his time polishing his martial skills and finding ever more powerful opponents to challenge in hand-to-hand combat.  \n  \n The Melipdra twins ultimately found themselves where many wanderers end up: the city of Absalom. They initially stayed in the Foreign Quarter, a district that Shristi fell in love with and which he now believes will be his final home. His martial prowess and ardent belief in justice soon led him to join the Sleepless Suns, where he rose in rank swiftly due to his penchant for non-violent resolutions and his aptitude at arresting criminals won't surrender quietly. When Rashmivati told Shristi she was leaving Absalom to open her own Pathfinder lodge back in Jalmeray, Shristi chose, after so many years together, to stay behind.  \n  \nNow nearly 60 years old, Shristi has fully embraced the life he built for himself among the guards of Absalom. His skill and dedication have earned him a sterling reputation for consistently avoiding serious injury to Absalom's citizens, even when forced to intervene in violent situations. Shristi is compassionate and empathetic to others seeking to earn a place for themselves within the city, but he has no tolerance for cruelty or predation from either the city folk or his own officers.",

                    "text": "The party first comes in contact with Sakuachi and her companions during their exploration of the abandoned city of Skywatch at the beginning of this adventure. Based on what the player characters learned about the alien entity Osoyo from the astronomers of Loskialua in the \u201cThe Seventh Arch,\u201d their investigation into the cause of the Missing Moment overlaps significantly with Sakuachi's quest to find and sacrifice a living god. Indeed, by the time the characters and their new friends escape Skywatch's dangers and reach safety on the shores of Mendev, their employer, Dr. Etward Ritalson, tasks the characters with helping Sakuachi fulfill her quest.  \n  \n Sakuachi's success will ultimately be the player characters' success, so it's important they see her as a key to solving their own mystery. In the next adventure, Sakuachi will need to sacrifice her spirit guide to seal away Osoyo once more, but this doesn't mean she's the star of the story. In fact, as they'll soon learn, the player characters are the primary instigators of the troubles which set Sakuachi's quest in motion in the first place. How this story ends is, ultimately, the party's decision to make.  \n  \n Sakuachi is more a scholar more than a fighter. During the times when she's accompanying the characters and a battle occurs, such as in Chapter 3 of \u201cThey Watched the Stars,\u201d she rarely (if ever) directly attacks a foe. In the heightened stress of combat, her connection to Ainamuuren may manifest as visions and flashes of memory as the saumen kar attempts to communicate with her, which allows her to Recall Knowledge about one or more of the creatures in combat using her Fortune-Telling Lore skill, though it also prevents her from participating in combat. Beyond providing information, she also can use spells like *resist energy* or *guidance* to support the party.  \n  \n***Recall Knowledge - Humanoid* (*Society*)**: DC 29  \n***Unspecific Lore***: DC 27  \n***Specific Lore***: DC 24",

            "text": "Sakuachi is the youngest scion in a long line of Erutaki seers. Like her forebears, she was born and raised in Aaminiut, a small town on the Crown of the World northeast of Avistan. Her mother Sialuk and her grandmother Seshu both taught Sakuachi how to see patterns in the ice below, read the stars above, and interpret the signs of the natural world all around.  \n  \n It was astronomy, above all other pursuits, which appealed most to Sakuachi. As a girl, she spent many long nights studying constellations, practicing with her astrolabe, and divining omens from the wisps and waves of the aurora. Before she was 5 years old, she'd already learned the names of every star configuration, the positions of the visible planets, and how to predict and interpret the movement of the celestial mantle. By the time she was a teenager, Sakuachi was the town's best astronomer.  \n  \n All the while, Elder Seshu looked proudly upon her granddaughter. But Seshu also bore the burden of a terrible secret\u2014she knew that, one day, her beloved Sakuachi would be forced to reckon with an ancient and terrible evil. On 21 Erastus of 4722 AR, at the close of Sakuachi's final summer before adulthood, unnatural blue lights beamed up from the center of the Crown of the World. Around Golarion, this occasion was known as the night of the Missing Moment. To Elder Seshu, it was a sign that the time had come for Sakuachi to fulfill her grim destiny.  \n  \n That night, Seshu dreamt of an ancient being of white fur, bestial horns, and glowing runic tattoos: Ainamuuren, the Last Saumen Kar. Seshu had befriended Ainamuuren long ago, and for years she'd listened to his dire warnings of a great evil that lurked beneath the Crown of the World. She hadn't seen her friend in many seasons, though, so his dream visit came as a surprise. In this dream, Ainamuuren told Seshu that his strength was fading, and that soon he wouldn't be able to maintain the magic that keeps the ancient evil sealed beneath the ice. To renew the seal, Ainamuuren explained, the saumen kar's magic would need to be renewed through the sacrifice of a god, a quest which only a mortal could undertake. As Seshu's dream vision faded to darkness, one of Ainamuuren's runes glowed brighter and longer than all the others.  \n  \n Early the following morning, Seshu met with the other elders and told them the time had come to send one of their own on a holy quest. As Seshu had predicted, her granddaughter Sakuachi eagerly volunteered to take on this quest. Together, the elders agreed that Sakuachi\u2014young and good of heart\u2014 should take on this great task. With her, the town sent four companions: the hunter Deniigi, the guide Innumma, the storyteller Pamak, and the navigator Ulikuq. Together, the group gathered and took a solemn vow to return to their homeland with a sacrificial god.  \n  \n Before the party left, Seshu took Sakuachi aside \u201cTo honor the one who has given us this quest,\u201d Seshu told the girl, \u201cyou must take his symbol as your own.\u201d Seshu held the nape of Sakuachi's neck firmly in her grasp, so much so that it hurt. Though the grip was tight, Sakuachi felt a warmth in her grandmother's palm. When her grandmother withdrew her palm, Sakuachi bore one of Ainamuuren's runes like a fresh tattoo.  \n  \n In his travels, the guide Innumma had heard of a land called Sarkoris, where gods still roamed the Material Plane, but no one in Aaminiut had ever been there. The town's most skilled sorcerer had visited a city called Skywatch long ago, so she teleported the group there to expedite their journey. Yet when they arrived, Sakuachi and her companions discovered the city strangely abandoned and full of danger. The streets seemed to writhe and twist under the group's feet, confusing their minds. They became separated, and Sakuachi barricaded herself in the city's observatory after being chased by violent raiders.  \n  \n Glancing through the observatory's telescope, Sakuachi prayed to the stars above for help in her challenging endeavor. Amazingly, the stars answered\u2014the telescope formed a magical conduit with astronomers on another planet, and they teleported a group of adventurers to Skywatch to help her. Even more astonishing, these \u201cgatewalkers\u201d bore the same rune of Ainamuuren as she did. The young seer believed in many wonders, but not coincidences. From then on, she knew that their destinies were intertwined, and she'd need to stay close to her strange new friends if she was to fulfill her quest.",

He asks the heroes to help him find out who has it so he can hunt them down and ensure they never steal from him again.\n* A rich and powerful noble has been thwarted by the PCs too many times. He's hired Pr'rall to hunt them down and bring them back: alive if possible, dead if necessary. Given the catfolk's growing proclivity for killing, it's likely he'll find a way to force the PCs' hands.\n  \n  \n***Recall Knowledge - Humanoid* (*Society*)**: DC 36  \n***Unspecific Lore***: DC 34  \n***Specific Lore***: DC 31",

Gold pays the bills, but the thrill of the hunt is the reason he always takes the next job.

He's begun to look into more than just bounty hunting, and is considering joining a local assassin's guild, though he's not sure if he wants to fully embrace his growing bloodlust.",

            "html": "<i>As the leader of the Scarlet Triad, Uri Zandivar has leveraged his extraordinary upbringing and training to dominate those he perceives as inferior in a bid for wealth, influence, and control of Hermea.</i><br/><br/> As a third-generation son of Hermea, Uri received an exemplary education funded by the dragon Mengkare's bottomless pockets. Even among the other Hermean students, Uri was exceptional, excelling at physical exploits, oratory, mysticism, and business. Desiring to see the world beyond Promise, he attained an honored role as one of Hermea's recruiters.<br/><br/> However, the more he saw of the world, the less convinced he was that the rest of humanity deserved any place alongside Mengkare. Jaded, he returned to Promise to seek the dragon's counsel. The golden sovereign was delighted in what he interpreted as Uri's growing wisdom and granted him a place on the Council of Enlightenment to help govern the island. As his influence increased, Uri earned ever-greater responsibilities, trust, and insight into Mengkare's vision for Hermea. But after witnessing the world's evils, he increasingly sensed derision and menace in Mengkare's words and mission. With his sister Emaliza (also a member of the Council of Enlightenment), Uri speculated as to their patron's nefarious designs and agreed to do whatever they could to protect Hermea.<br/><br/> While Emaliza remained on the island to research Mengkare's schemes, Uri left his post at the Council of Enlightenment to join the Scarlet Triad. He swiftly took over the group, which had become an increasingly disorganized operation as its role of providing recruits for the Glorious Endeavor grew less relevant. Under his leadership, the Triad was reinvigorated\u2014as much by his leadership as by his decision to engage in the lucrative slave trade. After several decades of prosperous chattel trafficking, keeping the Triad's new endeavors secret from Mengkare while still collecting the stipend of support from Hermea, Uri received a visit from his sister, who had come up with an audacious plan to seize control of Mengkare and his resources for themselves.<br/><br/> In that fateful meeting, Emaliza revealed to Uri that she'd discovered one of Promise's greatest secrets\u2014an ancient <i>aiudara</i> named Vengegate, within which was trapped the essence of the god Dahak. She further explained to Uri that Mengkare intends to use this essence somehow (misinterpreting Mengkare's goal of destroying Dahak for a wish to use the god's power as a weapon), and posited to her brother that if they could gain control of Mengkare and Alseta's Ring, this vast power would be theirs to use instead.<br/><br/> But Mengkare is dangerous, and Emaliza warned Uri that should the gold dragon discover their plot, he would surely destroy them. She then gave her brother several shards of the <i>Orb of Gold Dragonkind</i> she'd smuggled out of Mengkare's treasury. She wasn't able to retrieve them all, but knew that Mengkare had sent out other shards to various movers and shakers around the world as tokens and gifts. If Uri could use the resources of the Scarlet Triad to gather enough of these shards, and then recruit (or enslave) enough talented help, he could secretly rebuild the orb, allowing him and Emaliza to seize control of Mengkare. Emaliza knew that pursuing such an audacious plan in Promise would be too risky, but in Katapesh, her brother wouldn't have to worry about hiding the work from the dragon's attention.<br/><br/> Once Mengkare is controlled, Emaliza explained, nothing would stand in their way to harness the power of Dahak trapped in Alsetta's Ring. But until the orb was complete, Emaliza urged patience. In the meantime, she gave Uri the portal key for Vengegate and urged him to use his minions to gather up all the other portal keys to Alsetta's Ring they could find. Once Mengkare was under their control, they could then converge on the ring and harness the vast, destructive might hidden within, bolstering their position and making the Scarlet Triad a true global power. Convinced, Uri agreed to her plot.<br/><br/> True to his upbringing in Promise, Uri has subjected himself to a lifetime of physically and mentally grueling training regimens to measure up to Hermea's unforgiving standards. As a result, he has transformed his body into a living weapon with mastery of countless fighting styles. His keen eyes, unforgiving demeanor, and practiced counterattacks punish the imperfections of all who would challenge him. Uri is also a skilled negotiator, deceiver, and orator, groomed for leadership and inadvertently taught to respect few beyond Hermea's shores. His composed exterior belies his prejudiced derision of nearly everyone he works with."

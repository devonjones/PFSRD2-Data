Great-horned minotaurs can impale foes if they critically succeed on a charge, but they do not have the Hunted Fear ability. Shaggy minotaurs are covered in thick hair form head to toe, allowing them to live in freezing environments with ease and giving them resistance to cold damage, but their hooves are broad and heavy, making it impossible for them to charge.",

If the targets are in a maze or similarly difficult-to-navigate structure, the minotaur gains a +4 circumstance bonus to this check. Creatures that become frightened as a result also take a \u20132 circumstance penalty to Survival checks to avoid getting lost for 1 minute. Each target is temporarily immune for 1 minute."

Although there are many elementals and even natural terrain features that can give rise to cavern mages, most are related to the cavern-dwelling earth nymphs known as lampads. These lonely and capricious fey are as enthusiastic to receive the company of a kobold tribe as the kobolds are for the protection they receive in return.",

Fiends, elementals, or fey prove effective as alternate choices. Some kobolds use ancient artifacts instead, though this has the issue of attracting thieves. Kobolds in the Darklands usually seek out subterranean dragons, but those who absorb the ambient energy instead emerge with warped forms and terrifying psychic abilities.",

They lurk in dark spaces, usually tunnels and mines beneath the earth, in either warrens of their own design or complexes discovered and colonized after the original builders have moved on. Though kobolds are far more pragmatic than courageous, they use every inch of their cunning to even the playing field between themselves and other, stronger creatures. They attack from the darkness and at range, and kobold artificers and engineers master the art of simple but effective traps, which they use to protect their lairs. Kobolds are skilled at working together by necessity, and they often set up ambushes or hit-and-run assaults that allow them to do the most damage possible without being harmed in return.  \n  \n Kobolds are diligent and hardworking creatures. While some kobolds live in communal collectives that maintain neutral relations with the creatures around them, they can be easily swayed into serving malevolent powers or megalomaniacal leaders. This is in part due to kobolds' innate pragmatism, as they would rather concede to servitude than risk being killed, but it is also in part due to a reverence for the power they generally lack. Notably, kobold eggs left in the proximity of magical creatures or places tend to absorb similar traits from the exposure. The resulting physical changes mark the appearance of each tribe, but a few lucky kobolds are also born with magical power that reflects their tribe's patron.",

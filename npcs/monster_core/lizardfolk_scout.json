Their long history has taught them to be patient in all things, though this has seen them losing ground to hastier peoples in modern times.  \n  \n Lizardfolk refer to themselves as \u201ciruxi,\u201d though they have taken their common moniker among other peoples in stride. Most of their settlements are entirely communal, with hatchlings raised by anyone with the time and temperament for such a role. Iruxis dwell and thrive in all tropical and temperate biomes, but they are most at home in swamplands, coastal regions, and river lands. They are talented swimmers, and many of their major cities are partially submerged to take advantage of this fact, causing them to often be overlooked by others.

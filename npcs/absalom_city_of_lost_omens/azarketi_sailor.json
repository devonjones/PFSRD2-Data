Such sailors get to enjoy their time above deck while also having near-constant access to large bodies of water. Ship captains also appreciate having azarketis on board, as they're able to easily scrape barnacles off the hull, check the rudder, and help patch any leaks. Though they have a talent for swimming more than sailing, they've earned a reputation as lucky to have on board.",

Descendants of the ancient Azlanti, the azarketis survived the cataclysm of Earthfall by fleeing into the sea, where they were warped into amphibious forms by the alghollthu, the alien architects of Absalom's terrible demise. Generally found on the coast, azarketis favor life near a major body of water, as keeping their skin hydrated is a biological requirement. Though most azarketis live relatively peaceful lives of fishing or farming, they sometimes need to defend their homes against hostile forces, and some leave their communities to become adventurers. The following statistics may be used to represent commonly encountered azarketis.",

Tide tamers act as guardians for their communities, scouts at sea and on the shore, or even entertainers for land-bound people's amusement. They're generally found with one or more aquatic allies whom they've befriended. Several serve alongside Absalom's Wave Riders as scouts, animal interlocutors, and guides.",

Descendants of the ancient Azlanti, the azarketis survived the cataclysm of Earthfall by fleeing into the sea, where they were warped into amphibious forms by the alghollthu, the alien architects of Absalom's terrible demise. Generally found on the coast, azarketis favor life near a major body of water, as keeping their skin hydrated is a biological requirement. Though most azarketis live relatively peaceful lives of fishing or farming, they sometimes need to defend their homes against hostile forces, and some leave their communities to become adventurers. The following statistics may be used to represent commonly encountered azarketis.",

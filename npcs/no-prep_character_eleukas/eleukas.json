When he was old enough to join the Otari town guard, even the curmudgeonly Captain Longsaddle couldn't deny that the muscular lad had martial talent. What he didn't realize is that Eleukas also has heart. Though unsure of his own abilities, Eleukas joined with his friends to avert a serious threat to Otari, as described in *The Shroud of Four Silences*.  \n  \n Eleukas is an excellent example of a local folk hero. He's willing to raise his magical axe, *Visperath*, for coin, but he's more likely to raise it to protect the innocent.",

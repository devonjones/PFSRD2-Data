Although Zellara's grown more powerful as a ghost than she ever was in life, Raven is still beyond her ability to stop all on her own\u2014she needs the PCs to step up to this task. Zellara sees the same potential in these heroes as she saw in the heroes of Korvosa over a decade ago. She hopes that these heroes will be the ones to put an end to Raven's evil machinations, and perhaps even save her from herself. Having gained wisdom in her afterlife, Zellara can provide any information or advice the heroes might need on their journey to recover the Deck of Destiny.  \n  \n***Recall Knowledge - Spirit* (*Occultism*)**: DC 42  \n***Recall Knowledge - Undead* (*Religion*)**: DC 42  \n***Unspecific Lore***: DC 40  \n***Specific Lore***: DC 37",

            "text": "The Esmeranda clan was a storied group of traveling merchants, fortune-tellers, and performers whose lineage could be traced as far back as ancient Thassilon (or so the family tales say). When the eldest daughter of the clan, Zellara, found love during a visit to the city of Korvosa and elected to settle down in that city, the rest of the clan considered her departure bittersweet. Losing Zellara was a blow for the clan, but they were not about to interfere with the desires of her heart. Zellara bid her family farewell and settled down with her husband, Aramir, in the city's cosmopolitan Midland district. The two found a home, had a son, and generally lived a happy life for a few years.  \n  \n When Zellara lost Aramir to sickness, the rest of her clan urged her to return to them, but she had grown to love Korvosa and its people. She chose to stay and make a living as a harrower for tourists and interested locals. She also took on several students during this time, teaching them the honored tradition of harrowing that was passed down among her clan. Unfortunately, Zellara's love of the harrow would ultimately lead to her death.  \n  \n During an outing in the city, pickpockets working for a small-time criminal named Gaedren Lamm stole Zellara's cherished harrow deck. Her son Eran took it upon himself to recover the deck, only to end up dying at the hands of Gaedren's thugs. With her son dead and the city guard unable to help, Zellara searched for Eran's killer, eventually tracking down Gaedren to his hideout only to be slain by him as well. Overcome with anguish and despair at the moment of her death, Zellara's spirit connected to her harrow deck, allowing her to live on as a ghost intent on stopping Gaedren and protecting the city of Korvosa.  \n  \n As a ghost, Zellara recruited a group of heroes to help her with her goal. From her harrow, Zellara could advise the heroes and frequently performed harrow readings to guide them during their adventures. With Zellara's help, these heroes not only brought Gaedren to justice, but eventually liberated all Korvosa from the tyranny of its new ruler, Queen Ileosa Arabasti. In the final days of this campaign to save Korvosa, Zellara's deck become empowered, transforming into a *harrow deck of many things*. This new deck gave the heroes a greater advantage moving toward their final battle.  \n  \n Feeling she had accomplished her goal and could trust the heroes to save the city, Zellara's spirit moved on to the Boneyard. Once there, she awaited her soul's judgment, but realized that her connection to the power of the harrow deck of many things afforded her more liberty than other souls. She eventually discovered she could step \u201cout of line\u201d from her judgment, free to return when saw fit. Zellara saw this development as an opportunity to visit her loved ones one last time before moving on.  \n  \n Zellara returned to Golarion and watched the lives of her clan, the saviors of Korvosa, and her former students. She spent several years observing them from afar, occasionally providing subtle guidance to help them with their goals or problems. Among these was her final student, Raven Nicoletta. Zellara checked in with Raven several times over the years, watching her grow into a brilliant harrower, surpassing Zellara's skill and even some of the greatest harrowers of the Esmeranda clan. In recent years, however, Zellara watched Raven become selfish, obsessed with power and legacy, and fall into the ways of evil. Zellara remained with Raven, hoping to return her to a better path, but found herself no longer able to influence her former student. Raven was lost to her. Zellara now believes that Raven is beyond saving and, while mourning this loss, hopes to find someone to put an end to the evil Raven seeks to enact on the world.",

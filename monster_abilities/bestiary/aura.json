The monster doesn\u2019t need to spend actions on the aura; rather, the aura\u2019s effects are applied at specific times, such as when a creature ends its turn in the aura or when creatures enter the aura.  \n  \n If an aura does nothing but deal damage, its entry lists only the radius, damage, and saving throw. Such auras deal this damage to a creature when the creature enters the aura and when a creature starts its turn in the aura. A creature can take damage from the aura only once per round.  \n  \n The GM might determine that a monster\u2019s aura doesn\u2019t affect its own allies. For example, a creature might be immune to a monster\u2019s frightful presence if they have been around each other for a long time.",

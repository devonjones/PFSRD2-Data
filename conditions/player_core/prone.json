Standing up ends the prone condition. You can Take Cover while prone to hunker down and gain greater cover against ranged attacks, even if you don't have an object to get behind, which grants you a +4 circumstance bonus to AC against ranged attacks (but you remain off-guard).  \n  \n If you would be knocked prone while you're Climbing or Flying, you fall.

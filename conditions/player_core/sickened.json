You can't willingly ingest anything\u2014including elixirs and potions\u2014while sickened.  \n  \n You can spend a single action retching in an attempt to recover, which lets you immediately attempt a Fortitude save against the DC of the effect that made you sickened. On a success, you reduce your sickened value by 1 (or by 2 on a critical success).",

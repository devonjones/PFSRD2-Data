This is usually an activity requiring 2 actions, and it must be something that would reasonably improve your chances (as determined by the GM). For example, you might try to smother a flame or wash off acid. This allows you to attempt an extra flat check immediately, but only once per round.  \n  \nThe GM decides how your help works, using the following examples as guidelines when there's not a specific action that applies.  \n\n* The action to help might require a skill check or another roll to determine its effectiveness.\n* Reduce the DC of the flat check to 10 for a particularly appropriate type of help, such as dousing you in water to put out flames.\n* Automatically end the condition due to the type of help, such as healing that restores you to your maximum HP to end persistent bleed damage, or submerging yourself in a lake to end persistent fire damage.\n* Alter the number of actions required to help you if the means the helper uses are especially efficient or remarkably inefficient.",

If you would gain more than one persistent damage condition with the same damage type, the higher amount of damage overrides the lower amount. If it's unclear which damage would be higher, such as if you're already taking 2 persistent fire damage and then begin taking 1d4 persistent fire damage, the GM decides which source of damage would better fit the scene. The damage you take from persistent damage occurs all at once, so if something triggers when you take damage, it triggers only once; for example, if you're dying with several types of persistent damage, the persistent damage increases your dying condition only once.",

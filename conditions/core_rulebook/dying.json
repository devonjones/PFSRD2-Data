The most significant information not contained in the conditions themselves is this: When you\u2019re reduced to 0 Hit Points, you\u2019re knocked out with the following effects: \n* You immediately move your initiative position to directly before the turn in which you were reduced to 0 HP.\u201d\n* You gain the dying 1 condition. If the effect that knocked you out was a critical success from the attacker or the result of your critical failure, you gain the dying 2 condition instead. If you have the wounded condition, increase these values by your wounded value. If the damage came from a nonlethal attack or effect, you don\u2019t gain the dying condition\u2014 you are instead unconscious with 0 Hit Points.",

If you\u2019re dying, you must attempt a recovery check at the start of your turn each round to determine whether you get better or worse. Your dying condition increases by 1 if you take damage while dying, or by 2 if you take damage from an enemy\u2019s critical hit or a critical failure on your save.  \n  \nIf you lose the dying condition by succeeding at a recovery check and are still at 0 Hit Points, you remain unconscious, but you can wake up as described in that condition. You lose the dying condition automatically and wake up if you ever have 1 Hit Point or more. Any time you lose the dying condition, you gain the wounded 1 condition, or increase your wounded condition value by 1 if you already have that condition.",
